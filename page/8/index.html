          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2021-08-22_sporadic_naev_newsletter_vol_2/">Sporadic Naev
          Newsletter Vol. 2</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON AUGUST 22ND, 2021</p>
          <p>So it’s been over 10 years from the first edition of our <a href=
          "../../blarg/2010-07-16_sporadic_naev_newsletter_vol_1/">sporadic naev newsletter</a>, so
          it seems like it might be a good time to have the second edition. In the previous
          edition, we talked about the state of 0.5.0 and the introduction of big systems and
          electronic warfare. In this edition, we’ll talk about the state of 0.9.0 and new features
          like stealth and safe lanes.</p>
          <h4 id="state-of-090">State of 0.9.0</h4>
          <p>We’ve passed 5,500 commits from 0.8.2. This is going to be the largest amount of
          content and changes from any release ever with tons of graphical improvements, new
          mechanics, and new content added all over. It is already all live in the nightly images
          which are available from both <a href=
          "https://github.com/naev/naev/releases/tag/nightly">github</a> and steam via the opt-in
          beta. That said, it is recommended for you to back up your save or use a new one if you
          attempt to do this. At the current moment, you will lose many outfits and experience
          hiccups trying to use an old save game. Unlike the official releases, the nightly is
          still rather unpolished.</p>
          <p>Currently there is no hard ETA for the release, but we hope to release it within the
          year and follow a more timely release cycle. We hope that we’ll be able to do a feature
          freeze in a couple of months and focus exclusively on polish until the release. As
          always, we will release one or more betas before the official release to try to debug
          potential issues.</p>
          <h4 id="electronic-warfare-overhaul">Electronic Warfare Overhaul</h4>
          <p>Electronic warfare was originally introduced in 0.5.0. With the move to big systems,
          it no longer made sense for all ships to be visible at all times. Furthermore, we wanted
          to differentiate the roles between smaller and larger ships, while aiding survivability
          of small ships by making it harder for the largest of turrets to track them and hit them.
          While this worked well to some extent, it was never transparent to the player. We’ve
          revamped it this time around to be fully visible to the player. Each ship, depending on
          its mass and bonuses, will have three separate values: detection, evasion, and stealth,
          that control when the ship is first detected, when the ship details are shown and
          scanning is possible, and finally how well the ship can stealth.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "Electronic Warfare Redux - this time with understandable values!" src=
            "../../imgs/blarg/2021/SNN2/ewredux.png" width="500"></div>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
              Electronic Warfare Redux - this time with understandable values!
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Hiding is the most important attribute that controls when ships are detected at and
          affects both evasion and stealth. Evasion is usually 75% of detected at value, and
          controls how well turrets and missiles track a ship. Furthermore, it controls the
          distance at which a ship is scanned at. Scanning a ship allows you to see the details of
          cargo and outfits. Furthermore, patrol ships will scan your ship and make sure you don’t
          have illegal cargo.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "Player being scanned by a fleet led by an Empire Admonisher." src=
            "../../imgs/blarg/2021/SNN2/scanning.png" width="720"></div>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
              Player being scanned by a fleet led by an Empire Admonisher.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>That leads us to the final mechanic: stealth! Stealth allows ships to become
          completely invisible if no ships are within their stealth distance. When stealthed, ships
          get a -50% penalty to all movement: max speed, thrust, and turning. However, they cease
          to appear on all system sensors. This allows ships to sneak past systems or ships,
          opening lots of opportunities for contraband, piracy, and survival.</p>

          </figure>
          <h4 id="safe-lanes">Safe lanes</h4>
          <p>One of the last major gameplay changing features is safe lanes, which have been
          recently incorporated into the main branch. Safe lanes consist of routes in space that
          are more regularly patrolled. Most traders and factional systems will use these routes,
          while areas away from space lanes will naturally lead to more pirate activities. Core
          systems with many planets and stations will naturally lead to more safe lanes, while
          systems far away from core systems will end up having sparser lanes, or none at all.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "Safe lanes that look like Pacman." src="../../imgs/blarg/2021/SNN2/safelanes.png"
            width="720"></div>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
              Safe lanes that look like Pacman.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h4 id="ship-classification-redux">Ship Classification Redux</h4>
          <p>This is a more minor change, but rare ship classes, such as cruiser ships, or
          motherships have been removed. Other similar classes have been merged, such as heavy
          drones and fighters, which retain the name of fighters. Furthermore, fighters have been
          split into fighters and interceptors (light fighters), and cruisers have been split into
          cruisers and battleships (heavy cruisers). This changes are mainly there for the
          equipment algorithm and AI to exploit.</p>
          <h4 id="rebalance">Rebalance</h4>
          <p>Nearly all the outfits in the game have been modified or completely revamped. Core
          outfits and weapons have been designed to be based around 6 tiers: interceptor, fighter,
          corvette, destroyer, cruiser, and battleship. Utility outfits have been made to be based
          on conditional behaviour such as being below a certain armour threshold, or temporary
          behaviours. Finally, structural outfits have been made be stronger and play a more
          significant role in outfitting and not being left as an afterthought. Many new outfits
          have been added to fill in missing slots and roles, with many left to come.</p>
          <h4 id="visual-novel-framework">Visual Novel Framework</h4>
          <p>Another fairly large change is a Lua based visual novel framework that has been
          written from scratch. It allows to show images and special effects while having text
          progressively appear. This greatly enhances some of the storytelling ability of the game
          and allows creating more complex conditional branching behaviours.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Furthermore, the entire system is based on the <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÖVE
          framework</a> which we recently started to partially support by mimicking the API in
          Naev, and allows for nearly infinite customizations.</p>

          </figure>
          <h4 id="future-steps">Future Steps</h4>
          <p>There are lots of other improvements we have not mentioned in this newsletter: linear
          programming-based equipment optimization, discoveries, new missions, new ship attributes,
          more shader support, etc. We might go deeper into new features in future blarg posts as
          we refine and polish the mechanics.</p>
          <p>With regard to what is coming up, there are no too major things left to do. Besides
          overall polish, which will take most of the time, some new missions have to be written,
          in-system objects implemented, jamming rework, pricing rebalance, and a few odd ends here
          and there. We’re hoping for a release within this year, but given the ambition and scope
          of 0.9.0, we’d rather delay and have a better release, than rush it and have it be
          unplayable.</p>
          <p>If you wish to contribute to Naev, we have lots of things that can be done, even
          without programming experience! From <a href=

          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON JULY 18TH, 2021</p>
          <p><em>This post is about development on Naev 0.9.0.</em></p>
          <p>Even though explosions in space games generally defy the laws of physics, they are
          some of the better and necessary eye-candy. However, explosions in Naev remained
          unchanged since about 13 years ago. While not necessarily awful, they have always left a
          bit more to be desired. One idea that has been around for ages has been to try to redo
          them in procedural shaders to look better and more variable. With the <a href=
          "../../blarg/2021-04-09_trails/">recent</a> <a href=
          "../../blarg/2021-05-02_jumping/">shader</a> <a href=
          "../../blarg/2021-07-02_beam_me_up/">improvements</a>, it has never been a better time to
          revamp the other special effects.</p>

          <p>The explosions have been redone with <a href=

          procedural: each explosion should be completely unique. Furthermore, the explosion
          parameters can be tweaked to create plasma clouds or other special effects, replacing a
          large amount of image-based animations we were using. Images speak louder than words, so
          see for yourself the new explosions in action!</p>

          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON JULY 2ND, 2021</p>
          <p><em>This post is about development on Naev 0.9.0.</em></p>
          <p>So fact is, beams are cool. They can hit multiple targets and do a lot of damage while
          being accurate. Sure they have short range and bad tracking, but they more than make up
          for that in coolness factor. We thought about it and decided the only way to make beams
          cooler is to sprinkle some shader goodness on top. Not only will this make beams look
          great at any resolution, but it will also allow creating new beams easily, as there is no
          longer a need to muck around with graphic images.</p>
          <p>In the <a href="../../blarg/2021-06-06_lua_outfits/">blarg post about Lua outfits</a>,
          some of the new beams were already shown:</p>

          </figure>
          <p>There are also a lot of new beam graphics, some of which are not used yet, but open up
          a lot of exciting new possibilities. Look forward to more and fancier beams in the
          future.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">BY SYNCHRO, ON JUNE 21ST, 2021</p>
          <p>Howdy!</p>
          <p>This post coincides with the 11th year this blog has been up in some form.</p>
          <p>In early 2020, the new incarnation of naev.org was born, and with the new site came an
          unfortunate lack of the older historical posts from the old WordPress Naev site. With
          Naev being one of the older open source game projects out there (and one my my personal
          early forays into FOSS games) I realized that the history of this project is a good
          record to keep.</p>
          <p>With more than 10 years of history here it would be a crime not to attempt to restore
          as much of the old content as possible. With recent updates to the Blarg you can now
          browse through almost all of the posts from years past; be it <a href=
          "../../blarg/2012-08-19_slots_branch_merged/">explanations of ‘new’ mechanics</a>,
          <a href="../../blarg/2011-06-03_0.5.0/">past releases</a>, or some extra <a href=
          "../../blarg/2011-01-14_naev_etymology/">fun posts</a>. As important as viewing the past
          is it also lets us see how far this project has come and how far we can continue to
          expand this awesome game.</p>
          <p>On top of all this restored Blarg content, we will be attempting to bring older
          releases of Naev to modern Linux and Windows systems, on <a href=
          "https://store.steampowered.com/app/598530/Naev/">Steam</a>, <a href=
          "https://naev.itch.io/naev">Itch.io</a> and on our Github <a href=
          "https://github.com/naev/naev/releases/">Releases</a> page. This will give any brave
          souls the chance to see where Naev was at various points in time. Be it for nostalgia’s
          sake or to see how things were 5 years ago.</p>
          <p>Present day sees a lot of cool new things brewing in the development builds of Naev,
          but I’ll leave that for future Blarg posts :)</p>
          <p>As always, feel free to join our <a href=
          "https://discord.com/invite/nd2M5BR">Discord</a> and say hi.</p>
          <p>Happy Reading!</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2021-06-06_lua_outfits/">Utility Outfits</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON JUNE 6TH, 2021</p>
          <p><em>This post is about development on Naev 0.9.0.</em></p>
          <p>Most non-weapon outfits in Naev have consisted of simple modifications, with some
          notable exceptions like afterburners. This has always meant that most of the game is
          built around setting up outfits, without non-weapon outfits playing an active role in
          combat. In order to allow much more flexible outfit design, we have incorporated Lua, the
          widely used scripting language in Naev and other projects, into the outfits.</p>
          <p>The result? Now outfits can react to environmental conditions or trigger in certain
          instances. Furthermore, the behaviours don’t have to be fixed, but can be dynamically set
          during runtime. This allows doing simple things like having outfits give you bonuses
          above certain shield levels, or depending on nearby ships. Below are some examples of
          what can be done with this.</p>
          <p>The <strong>Emergency Stasis Inducer</strong> will automatically trigger when your
          ship takes armour damage. Not only will it slow down time around you, it will also speed
          up your ship for a great bullet time effect!</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Do you like holograms? Would you like to project a fully equipped model of your ship
          into space to distract your enemies while you blast them into smithereens? The
          revolutionary <strong>Combat Hologram Projector</strong> does just that!</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive video720p">
            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 figure-img">

          <p>Have you ever felt so angry that you wanted to slow down time and get a large bonus to
          damage while you damage yourself? Think no further, the <strong>Berserk Chip</strong>
          does just that, without making you turn green and rip out of your shirt!</p>

          <p>Of course, it would only be right to pay homage to the original <strong>Cloaking
          Device</strong> by implementing it in Naev. While active, nobody will see you, and you
          will be able to do what you please freely.</p>

          <p>Other than these showcased outfits, there are many more to explore, however, we leave
          that up to you to look forward to in-game!</p>
