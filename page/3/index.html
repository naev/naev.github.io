          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2023-07-30_new_autonav/">New Autonav</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON JULY 30TH, 2023</p>
          <p><em>This post is about development on Naev 0.11.0.</em></p>
          <p>Pirates have always been an issue for the law-abiding player. They are everywhere and
          relentless. However, with the <a href=
          "../../blarg/2021-08-22_sporadic_naev_newsletter_vol_2/">addition of patrol lanes in
          0.9.0</a>, the universe has become a safer place, at least where the patrol lanes exist.
          Although that made things much easier for the player, a gaping flaw was that the autonav
          system did not understand how to use these lanes. For 0.11.0, we implemented the long
          awaited feature that <strong>autonav will now use patrol lanes if configured
          to!</strong>.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive video720p">
            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 figure-img">
              <video controls="" class="embed-responsive-item"><source src=
              "../../videos/blarg/2023_07_autonav_the_lanes.webm" type=
              'video/webm;codecs="vp9, opus"'></video>
            </div>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
              A Llama using the autonav system to stick to patrol lanes.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>So how does this work? By default, autonav will use patrol lanes of non-hostile
          factions when jumping, and will not use them otherwise. You can configure it to not use
          lanes for jump, and also to use lanes for landing on planets or stations from the new
          settings option accessible in the info menu. The settings button replaces and
          incorporates the “Set GUI” functionality.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "New player settings are accessible from the info window." src=
            "../../imgs/blarg/2023/autonav_settings.png"></div>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
              New player settings are accessible from the info window.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>To get this working the entire autonav system was scrapped and rewritten, this also
          has the added effect of being much more accurate and efficient when travelling around.
          Overall it’s a win-win situation! Hopefully this will ease the early game and save many
          pilots from meeting their fate at the hands of the hordes of marauders lurking in the
          darkness.</p>
          <p>As always, you can opt-in to the <code>nightly</code> beta branch on steam, or
          download the nightly from itch.io or github to get the latest and greatest of Naev
          development. Due note that this can be unstable, and make sure to back up your 0.10 saves
          first!</p>

          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON JULY 18TH, 2023</p>
          <p><em>This post is about development on Naev 0.11.0.</em></p>
          <p>At the 2nd anniversary of posting about implementing <a href=
          "../../blarg/2021-07-18_future_goes_boom/">raymarched fancy explosions</a>, it’s time to
          talk about trying to use the system to its full potential. And by full potential, I mean
          custom ship explosions!</p>
          <p>All of the factional ships have been given custom explosions, some slightly different
          from the “standard” explosions, while others have much more radical changes, including
          different explosion types, secondary effects, and radically different colours. Time to
          explode and damage have also been changed, while some explosions now do different damage
          types and/or apply disabling effects. This should help have the different factions and
          ships feel more different.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive video720p">
            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 figure-img">
              <video controls="" class="embed-responsive-item"><source src=
              "../../videos/blarg/2023_07_explosions.webm" type=

              Showcase of the different faction ship explosions.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>From the technical side of things, custom ship explosions are done by using Lua
          scripting for ships, similar as what was <a href=
          "../../blarg/2021-06-06_lua_outfits/">done for outfits</a>. This opens up a whole new
          possibility of what can be done with ships, I won’t cover other things being done with
          this yet, but it has to do with the Great House Sirius rework which brings about psychic
          powers. All these changes will be included in version 0.11.0 which should be released
          around December this year. Lots of exciting development to look for for the rest of
          2023!</p>

          <p class="text-muted">BY NAEV DEVTEAM, ON FEBRUARY 12TH, 2023</p>
          <p><em>This post is about development on Naev 0.11.0.</em></p>
          <p>Since 0.10.0 was released, those of you on nightly builds have probably noticed that
          not much has been going on. Truth is, development has been going on in a parallel
          <code>newmap</code> branch that just got merged into main, and will appear in the next
          nightly. Why the parallel development? Although Naev has seen many changes during it’s
          development, the fundamental layout of the universe has remained largely unchanged.
          However, this was sort of unmaintainable due to inconsistencies with the lore of the Naev
          universe, and, after the release of 0.10.0, we thought it was a good idea to revisit and
          rethink about how the universe itself is laid out to make it more consistent.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>What does this mean? Although an effort has been taken to try to keep most of the
          underlying topology, that is, what systems are connected to what systems, there were
          limits to what we could conserve and the result is that lots of things have been changed.
          This is particularly pronounced near around the Nebula with many new systems and
          interesting space objects being added. There are also many new secrets you can find that
          can be quite useful to your player character, we leave it up to you to find them.</p>
          <p>You can try the development version if you are brave (<strong>please back up your
          saves first!</strong>) by getting the images available from both <a href=
          "https://github.com/naev/naev/releases/tag/nightly">github</a> and steam via the opt-in
          beta.</p>
