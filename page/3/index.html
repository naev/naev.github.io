          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON DECEMBER 9TH, 2023</p>
          <p>During playtesting 0.11.0-beta.1, we’ve found a bunch of bugs and issues that we’ve
          addressed. In particular, some of the more important ones include having the slim GUI
          show what outfits are being activated, which is particularly useful for toggle weapon
          sets, and fixed some issues with collisions making it hard for fast weapons to hit their
          targets. As always, please report any issues on <a href=
          "https://github.com/naev/naev/issues">this tracker</a>, and feel free to join our Discord
          or Matrix chatrooms. Find out more about them <a href=
          "https://naev.org/contact/">here!</a></p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2023-12-03_0.11.0-beta.1/">Naev 0.11.0-beta.1</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON DECEMBER 3RD, 2023</p>
          <p>It’s nearing the end of the year and that means time for a new Naev release! This
          release is once again one that revamps a lot of existing features and legacy code, while
          adding lots of new content and features. Like always, instead of doing a release
          directly, we’re going to be doing a series of betas to try to ensure as few bugs as
          possible sneak into the final release. We plan to do the official release in about two
          weeks from now, but it will depend on how many issues and the likes are found.</p>
          <p>Now, this release changes a lot of how the game currently plays, and, while it is
          highly recommended to start a new game, it should be possible to just load up your old
          saves without too much stuff being changed. In particular, some of the major changes
          are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Significantly reworked universe map to fit existing lore</li>
            <li>House Sirius completely reworked</li>
            <li>Significantly improved autonav that uses lanes and is configurable</li>
            <li>Reworked structural outfits and number of ship slots</li>
            <li>Weapon sets are more simple with no distinction between weapons and
            non-weapons</li>
            <li>Possible to legally obtain all “standard” factional ships and outfits</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If you try it and find any issues, please report them at <a href=
          "https://github.com/naev/naev/issues">the issue tracker</a>. Discussion about the game
          can be had on one of the various discussion forums and chatrooms we have. Check them out
          <a href="https://naev.org/contact/">here!</a></p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2023-09-05_sporadic_naev_newsletter_vol_3/">Sporadic Naev
          Newsletter Vol. 3</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON SEPTEMBER 5TH, 2023</p>
          <p>Rather than waiting 10 years again from the previous edition of our <a href=
          "../../blarg/2021-08-22_sporadic_naev_newsletter_vol_2/">sporadic naev newsletter</a>,
          we’ve only let 2 years pass this time. In this edition, we’ll talk about some
          improvements in 0.10.0 that may have gone under the radar, and the upcoming 0.11.0
          release.</p>
          <h4 id="state-of-0110">State of 0.11.0</h4>
          <p>With <a href="https://github.com/naev/naev/compare/0.10.x...main">a ton of commits and
          content since 0.10.0</a>, things are starting to shape up for 0.11.0. This release has
          focused greatly on reworking and improving existing systems by bringing up to modern
          standards. In particular, things such as how weapons are implemented, how ship stats are
          dealt with, autonav internals, npc/news/derelict internals, reworking old missions into
          the visual novel system, etc. have been mainly rewritten to improve shortcomings. While
          this is not really visible in the end product directly, it has enabled a lots of new
          features and improved the overall robustness of the game.</p>
          <p>However, this release is much more than just elimination of technical debt, as this
          release features a lot of new content in pretty much every area of the game: more events,
          more missions, more lore, more outfits, and more locations. The icing on the cake are new
          mechanics such as point defense systems, flow mechanics, and trials. Overall this is
          shaping up to be quite a large release and we are excited to share it with you.</p>
          <h4 id="universe-revisited">Universe Revisited</h4>
          <p>As <a href="../../blarg/2023-02-12_universe_revisited/">mentioned before on the
          blarg</a>, the universe has been completely rework for 0.11.0. The universe should have a
          much more natural feel that matches the lore, with the Sol Nebula being more omnipresent
          as you travel around. This has required significant changes to many systems and system
          objects, so that many places you knew will probably seem familiar but quite different at
          the same time. It may take a while to get used to.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "Stumbling upon a ruined space station in the Nebula." src=

            <figcaption class="figure-caption">

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>In numbers, some 67 new systems and 123 new space objects have been added, mainly
          around the Sol Nebula to give a more in-depth sensation of destruction and the fragility
          of humankind. Besides the typical planets and stations, these systems also contain many
          secrets that you can uncover.</p>
          <h4 id="house-sirius-rework">House Sirius Rework</h4>
          <p>For 0.10.0, the Soromid got a major rework by getting true bioships that can level up
          and learn different skills, now it’s only fair for the neglected House Sirius to also get
          the same treatment. Instead of extreme biological engineering, House Sirius relies on
          psychic abilities called flow. While individuals don’t possess very strong powers by
          themselves, House Sirius has designed their ships to be powerful amplifiers to be able to
          unleash potent abilities on the battle field.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>The player will also be able to obtain similar psychic powers and unlock the full
          potential through new tests that can be found throughout space. Each test will require
          the player to overcome obstacles in order to unlock new abilities and also increase their
          overall psychic powers.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=

              Complete tests to unlock new psychic powers.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>While Sirius ships have flow capability built-in, other ships can also use structural
          outfits to enable flow capability, allowing for more customization. That said, Sirius
          ships get unique bonuses from flow powers which are not available to other ships.</p>
          <h4 id="plugin-system">Plugin System</h4>
          <p>Although the <a href="../../blarg/2022-12-23_0.10.0/">plugin system was introduced in
          0.10.0</a>, it has gone largely unnoticed. Currently, it is possible to replace and
          modify all parts of the Naev that are implemented in Lua, which includes important parts
          such as <a href="../../blarg/2023-07-30_new_autonav/">autonav</a>, <a href=
          "../../blarg/2021-06-06_lua_outfits/">many outfits</a>, <a href=
          "../../blarg/2023-07-18_ships_go_boom/">ship explosions</a>, and more! Not only that,
          Naev has option networking built in with <a href="http://enet.bespin.org/">enet</a>,
          allowing for networking functionality. On this line, there is a very much WIP <a href=
          "https://github.com/ThrosturX/naev-multiplayer">multiplayer plugin</a>, that allows for
          playing with other people. To make development somewhat easier, a <a href=
          "https://naev.org/devmanual/">development manual</a> is being worked on, which covers
          things like how to write content for Naev and how to structure plugins. Given the
          advanced programming possibilities with the <a href="https://naev.org/api/">Naev Lua
          API</a>, the only limit is your imagination!</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Oh, there is <a href=
          "https://github.com/naev/total_conversion_plugin_example">explicit support for total
          conversions</a> too!</p>
          <h4 id="new-content">New Content</h4>
          <p>There’s also a bunch of new content being worked on. Not only have the NPCs and news
          you can find at the spaceport bar been greatly reworked to me more relevant to the
          context at hand, but many new missions, factions, and mechanisms have been implemented.
          The new universe has also given opportunities to diversify the different factions and
          make them feel more unique, from taunts to landing messages.</p>
          <p>First of all, with optimizations done to the engine, it’s finally possible to have
          efficient point defense systems, something that has been asked for by players for a long
          time. Point defense systems will automatically target nearby missiles, torpedoes, and
          even interceptors! Of course the exact specs will depend on the outfit, Guardian Systems
          use powerful lasers to focus on torpedoes or interceptors, while Soromid Spittle Clusters
          have been bio-engineered to create screens of bubbles to block weaker, but faster
          missiles.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>A new neutral faction has been created to replace the old Trader’s Guild. The new
          Space Traders Society is an organization that spans different guilds and has important
          subfactions such as the mercenary guild Astra Vigilis, the Mining Vrata, and the Imperial
          Red Star. They have important presence in several systems where new outfits are also
          available for trade.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Finally, more events missions have been added throughout the universe, and although
          not finished yet, we expect the conclusion to the Minerva campaign to make it into
          0.11.0.</p>
          <h4 id="game-optimization">Game Optimization</h4>
          <p>One issue Naev has traditionally had with the large systems it features, is slow downs
          when many pilots were fighting each other as a result of a primitive collision system.
          Well, it is no longer an issue as the current system has been reworked with <a href=
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree">quadtrees</a>. Testing shows that it is much
          much faster in extreme cases, with the game easily handling hundreds of ships fighting
          each other without slowing down. Furthermore, many aspects of the game have been profiled
          and optimized such that the game should run much more fluid than 0.10.0.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "Naev running smoothly at 60 FPS despite 50 Dvaered Vendettas fighting with 50 FLF Lancelots."

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Tests show that where Naev 0.10.0 would choke and become a slide show, Naev 0.11.0
          will be able to run without a hitch, such as 50 Dvaered Vendettas fighting with 50 FLF
          Lancelots. That said, given the high levels of time compressions capital ships can reach,
          it is likely in some extreme cases you may experience some slow downs.</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2023-07-30_new_autonav/">New Autonav</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON JULY 30TH, 2023</p>
          <p><em>This post is about development on Naev 0.11.0.</em></p>
          <p>Pirates have always been an issue for the law-abiding player. They are everywhere and
          relentless. However, with the <a href=
          "../../blarg/2021-08-22_sporadic_naev_newsletter_vol_2/">addition of patrol lanes in
          0.9.0</a>, the universe has become a safer place, at least where the patrol lanes exist.
          Although that made things much easier for the player, a gaping flaw was that the autonav
          system did not understand how to use these lanes. For 0.11.0, we implemented the long
          awaited feature that <strong>autonav will now use patrol lanes if configured
          to!</strong>.</p>

          <p>So how does this work? By default, autonav will use patrol lanes of non-hostile
          factions when jumping, and will not use them otherwise. You can configure it to not use
          lanes for jump, and also to use lanes for landing on planets or stations from the new
          settings option accessible in the info menu. The settings button replaces and
          incorporates the “Set GUI” functionality.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>To get this working the entire autonav system was scrapped and rewritten, this also
          has the added effect of being much more accurate and efficient when travelling around.
          Overall it’s a win-win situation! Hopefully this will ease the early game and save many
          pilots from meeting their fate at the hands of the hordes of marauders lurking in the
          darkness.</p>
          <p>As always, you can opt-in to the <code>nightly</code> beta branch on steam, or
          download the nightly from itch.io or github to get the latest and greatest of Naev
          development. Due note that this can be unstable, and make sure to back up your 0.10 saves
          first!</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2023-07-18_ships_go_boom/">Ships Go Boom</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON JULY 18TH, 2023</p>
          <p><em>This post is about development on Naev 0.11.0.</em></p>
          <p>At the 2nd anniversary of posting about implementing <a href=
          "../../blarg/2021-07-18_future_goes_boom/">raymarched fancy explosions</a>, it’s time to
          talk about trying to use the system to its full potential. And by full potential, I mean
          custom ship explosions!</p>
          <p>All of the factional ships have been given custom explosions, some slightly different
          from the “standard” explosions, while others have much more radical changes, including
          different explosion types, secondary effects, and radically different colours. Time to
          explode and damage have also been changed, while some explosions now do different damage
          types and/or apply disabling effects. This should help have the different factions and
          ships feel more different.</p>

            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 figure-img">
              <video controls="" class="embed-responsive-item"><source src=
              "../../videos/blarg/2023_07_explosions.webm" type=

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>From the technical side of things, custom ship explosions are done by using Lua
          scripting for ships, similar as what was <a href=
          "../../blarg/2021-06-06_lua_outfits/">done for outfits</a>. This opens up a whole new
          possibility of what can be done with ships, I won’t cover other things being done with
          this yet, but it has to do with the Great House Sirius rework which brings about psychic
          powers. All these changes will be included in version 0.11.0 which should be released
          around December this year. Lots of exciting development to look for for the rest of
          2023!</p>
