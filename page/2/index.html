          available as a Native Apple Silicon app!</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY NAEV DEVTEAM, ON JANUARY 15TH, 2024</p>
          <p>Naev is now available as a Native Apple Silicon app!</p>
          <p>Starting with 0.11.2, any versions of Naev released in the future will include native
          support for Apple Silicon. Nightly releases are included. This should benefit users that
          have an Apple device with Apple Silicon (M1, M2, etc.), with significant speedups
          compared to running Naev with Rosetta. For running Apple Silicon builds of Naev make sure
          you are running macOS 11.0 or higher. Users with Intel Macs can still run Naev on macOS
          10.13 or higher.</p>
          <p>Enjoy!</p>
          <p>You can get this new version from any of the following sources:</p>

          <p>Inside the improvements of 0.11.1, a critical bug that seems to affect release-version
          windows only sneaked in. This bug causes autonav to basically crash the game when
          activated in certain conditions. Given that this makes the game pretty much unplayable on
          affected systems, we created a new version that should solve the issue. Thanks to all
          those reported and involved in the fixing!</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2023-12-23_0.11.0/">Naev 0.11.0</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY NAEV DEVTEAM, ON DECEMBER 23RD, 2023</p>
          <p>Following the winter tradition, the Naev DevTeam is proud to announce the release of
          version 0.11.0. This is again quite a large release that has rewritten and reworked large
          parts of the engine and long-established mechanics to be more flexible, faster, and
          efficient. Many long-term players will notice that many things they had gotten used to
          have been changed, starting from the Naev universe itself.</p>
          <p>We would like to thank all the contributors who have participated and helped in the
          making of this release.</p>
          <p>Most notable changes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reworked universe map to fit existing lore</li>
            <li>House Sirius completely reworked</li>
            <li>Improved autonav that uses lanes and is configurable</li>
            <li>Reworked structural outfits and number of ship slots</li>
            <li>Weapon sets are more simple with no distinction between weapons and
            non-weapons</li>
            <li>Possible to legally obtain all “standard” factional ships and outfits</li>
            <li>Point defense weapons that automatically fire at fighters and missiles</li>
            <li>A lot more content</li>
            <li>Significant engine speed-ups</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The new version should be compatible with older save games, and will update things as
          necessary. However, in this release, given the big changes done to the universe, old
          saves will potentially have the their universe map in a bit of a mess.</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2023-12-14_0.11.0-beta.3/">Naev 0.11.0-beta.3</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON DECEMBER 14TH, 2023</p>
          <p>During playtesting 0.11.0-beta.2, we’ve found even more issues that have been fixed,
          including some hard crashes and some inconsistencies with weapon set behaviours.
          Additionally, lots more quality of life usability such as in range weapon sets only
          shooting when enemies are in arcs have also been added. We’re hoping this to be the last
          beta before the official release which should hit in a week or so. As always, please
          report any issues on <a href="https://github.com/naev/naev/issues">this tracker</a>, and
          feel free to join our Discord or Matrix chatrooms. Find out more about them <a href=
          "https://naev.org/contact/">here!</a></p>
