          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2012-04-15_0.5.3/">Naev 0.5.3 Release</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY DEIZ, ON APRIL 15TH, 2012</p>
          <p>The Naev development team is proud to announce the release of Naev 0.5.3. This release
          fixes several bugs and introduces a few minor features. We aim for this to be the final
          release in the 0.5.x series, with 0.6.0 following in the not-so-distant future and
          bringing significant changes to ship equipping.</p>
          <p>Perhaps most importantly, we’ve introduced a non-gameplay feature, portable mode. On
          launch, Naev will now look for a file named <a href=
          "https://github.com/naev/naev/blob/v0.5.3/extras/win_installer/datapath.lua">datapath.lua</a>
          in the same directory as the Naev binary. The Windows installer provides this as an
          option, making it easy to install and run Naev from removable media.</p>
          <p>Note that if you want to use portable mode with your existing saves, you’ll need to
          migrate your files manually. For Windows users, this means moving
          <code>%APPDATA%\naev\</code> to <code>naev-data\</code> within the directory Naev is
          installed to.</p>

            placed in arbitrary locations.</li>
            <li>Afterburners now gradually overheat and have no fixed duration.</li>
            <li>Active cooldown allows for rapid ship cooling.</li>

          Cycle</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON APRIL 7TH, 2012</p>
          <p>Since 0.5.2′s release two weeks ago, a number of bugs have been caught and fixed, and
          several minor features have been implemented. We’ve decided to do another release in the
          short-term (0.5.3) which will hopefully be the last of the 0.5 series.</p>
          <p>Following 0.5.3, our major focus will be implementing and polishing the slots proposal
          (essentially, making a ship’s core systems separately upgradable). This and a number of
          smaller features will be incorporated into 0.6.0.</p>
          <p>Therefore, in order to make sure the last of the 0.5 releases is as bug-free as
          possible, we urge everyone to report any and all issues. Testing with a Git master build
          is preferred, as several issues have been fixed since 0.5.2, but bug reports from 0.5.2
          are welcome. Check the <a href="https://github.com/naev/naev/issues">issue tracker</a> to
          make sure it’s not a duplicate. Safe flying!</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2012-04-02_so_afterburners/">So, afterburners</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BTAXIS, ON APRIL 2ND, 2012</p>
          <p>As some of you may have noticed, the last few releases have introduced changes to the
          afterburner outfit. Where you could run it continuously so long as your ship had energy
          before, now it can only be on for a certain about of time, after which it needs to
          recharge. Also, in 0.5.2, activating the afterburner will abort the autonav.</p>
          <p>The reasoning behind this is that the afterburner is a combat-oriented outfit, whereas
          most people were using it to speed up their ship during travel, particularly during rush
          missions. Effectively, an afterburner would speed up a ship – a lot – for no appreciable
          cost. This we wanted to discourage. Speed at long ranges should come from speccing for
          speed by going light on weapons and using passive outfits, not from abusing the
          afterburner.</p>
          <p>However, some people raised some legitimate complaints about the changes we made. For
          instance, making the afterburner recharge over the same time period irrespective of how
          long it was on is unpleasant and counter to what you might expect. Aborting the autonav
          was just an added irritation, not an incentive not to use the afterburner. After all,
          afterburning in 1x time would still get you to your destination in less in-game time than
          not using it in time compression would. Finally, limiting the afterburner’s time wasn’t
          really making the afterburner ineffective at speeding up the ship over long distances, it
          was only making it a bit LESS effective.</p>
          <p>Reason for us to tackle the problem from a different angle. The afterburner should not
          be made annoying to use. Instead, it should simply be made unfit for the purposes it
          wasn’t intended for. To do this, we picked up an idea we discussed early in the
          afterburner overhaul: making afterburners generate heat.</p>
          <h4 id="heat-based-afterburners">Heat based afterburners</h4>
          <p>In their latest incarnation, afterburners generate heat when active, in the same way
          weapons generate heat when being fired. And, like weapons, afterburners get less
          effective when they heat up. When the afterburner starts to overheat, the speed and
          thrust bonuses it provides decrease, until afterburning is no faster than regular
          thrusting.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img">
              &lt;img class='img-fluid' alt='An afterburner that's heating up'
              src="/imgs/blarg/2012/04/screenshot000.png" /&gt;
            </div>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
              An afterburner that's heating up
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Because heat drains into the ship much slower than it builds up when afterburning, the
          afterburner can’t be on all the time even if energy permits. In fact, for the player it’s
          best to use the afterburner only occasionally and in short bursts. This naturally makes
          it more suitable for use in combat than for speed boosts across large distances.</p>
          <p>The heat based afterburners behave just like the original ones otherwise. They don’t
          have an enforced recharge cycle and can be used at any time, with the sole exception that
          it will shut off automatically when completely overheated, and can only be turned on if
          it’s cooler than 70% of its maximum heat.</p>
          <h4 id="getting-rid-of-heat">Getting rid of heat</h4>
          <p>Afterburners using heat is nice, but it adds another source of heat to a ship that is
          already having to deal with heat from other sources. When a ship’s hull heats up, the
          outfits installed in it won’t cool as fast, or not at all. Especially in combat, this can
          be a big problem – both for the player and the AI. In fact, a fight can degenerate in
          what I call “heat deadlock”, where all parties have heated up so much that their weapons
          aren’t shooting much anymore, so shield regeneration outpaces damage done across the
          board.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "A Lancelot in Active Cooldown mode. When the bar has completely emptied, the cycle is complete."
            src="../../imgs/blarg/2012/04/screenshot001.png"></div>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
              A Lancelot in Active Cooldown mode. When the bar has completely emptied, the cycle is
              complete.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>To combat this, we have introduced a new mechanic to the game, called Active Cooldown.
          When in Active Cooldown, a ship very rapidly loses its heat until both hull and outfits
          hit the baseline temperature. The process depends largely on the ship, with small ships
          taking less than 10 seconds to cool and big ships taking around 30. When you consider
          that under normal circumstances, it can literally take hours and hours (real time!) to
          lose heat, Active Cooldown is a very, very fast way to lose heat.</p>
          <p>So, you wonder aloud to nonexistent auditory organs, what’s the catch? There are two
          catches, as it turns out. The first catch is that to enter Active Cooldown, a ship must
          be stationary, and while it is cooling, it can’t take any other action. So in a combat
          situation, Active Cooldown makes you very vulnerable. The second catch is that heat is
          lost at an exponential rate – the longer you wait, the faster heat is lost. This means
          that it is highly desirable to wait until the end of the Active Cooldown cycle, as
          opposed to waiting only a portion of the time and then getting back into action. Active
          Cooldown can’t effectively be “pulsed” to quickly lose some heat in the middle of a
          fight.</p>
          <p>Hopefully, these two changes to gameplay will go a long way in making afterburners the
          tools they’re meant to be without being disruptive to gameplay, as well as making heat
          much less of a problem to prolonged trips through the galaxy.</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2012-03-29_lua_api_docs_added_to_naev_org/">Lua API Docs Added
          to Naev.org</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY DEIZ, ON MARCH 29TH, 2012</p>
          <p>Naev’s Lua API documentation has finally been integrated as a part of <a href=
          "https://naev.org">naev.org</a>, under its very own subdomain: <a href=
          "https://naev.org/api/">api.naev.org</a>.</p>
          <p>Some may note that the documentation has been around for some time, and that’s true.
          In fact, the effort dates to 2008, and has been kept in sync with the code ever since.
          It’s historically been hosted on a small VPS by bobbens, with a handful of links to it
          peppered throughout the <a href="https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki">Wiki</a>, as well as
          a mention in the IRC channel’s topic (RIP Freenode) (though I suspect 95% of IRC users
          never read channel topics).</p>
          <p>With any luck, making the API documentation more easily accessible will spur on some
          mission developers. I’d be remiss if I didn’t reiterate a bit of the API documentation’s
          preamble: Naev includes an in-game Lua console, accessible via <strong>F2</strong>, by
          default. It provides access to the majority of the Lua API (excepting a few things that
          are tied to missions and events, such as the hook module) and is a useful tool for
          ~~cheating~~ testing code snippets for use in missions.</p>
          <p>So, venture forth to Alteris and try something like:</p>
          <p><code>for k,v in ipairs(pilot.get( faction.get("Pirate") )) do v:setHealth(0, 0)
          end</code></p>
          <p>… because as everybody knows, you’re not having fun until you’re surrounded by
          spontaneously-exploding pirates.</p>

          <p>The Naev development team is proud to announce the release of Naev 0.5.2. This is
          mainly a bugfix release, though it also introduces a small amount of content in the form
          of missions and outfits.</p>
          <p>The new asset discovery mechanics have bothered quite a few people, so we’ve
          introduced a jump scanner outfit that greatly increases jump detection range, as well as
          local maps which behave similarly to the traditional star maps found in 0.5.0 and earlier
          releases.</p>
          <p>Now, as per usual it’s time for some statistics, from 0.5.1 to 0.5.2:</p>
          <p>83 files changed, 2408 insertions(+), 574 deletions(-)</p>
          <p>More than half of the added lines come from the dat/ directory tree, thanks in large
          part to a new event and a repeatable mission for the Sirius faction.</p>
