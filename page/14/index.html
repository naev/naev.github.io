          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2015-02-17_0.6.0-beta1/">0.6.0-beta1 Release</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY DEIZ, ON FEBRUARY 17TH, 2015</p>
          <p>Our last release was 0.5.3, way back in April 2012. Two years, ten months and some
          1400 commits later, we’ve finally prepared another release.</p>
          <p>We are proud to announce the 0.6.0-beta1 release today, and with any luck the final
          0.6.0 stable version will be released before March.</p>
          <p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=
          "https://sourceforge.net/projects/naev/files/naev-0.6.0/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/naev/files/naev-0.6.0/</a></p>
          <p><strong>Blog:</strong> <a href="https://naev.org/">https://naev.org/</a></p>
          <p><strong>Forums:</strong> http://forum.naev.org/ (Forums are lost.)</p>
          <p>A full changelog will accompany the stable release, but a few of the highlights
          include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="../../blarg/2012-08-19_slots_branch_merged/">Core slots system</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="../../blarg/2014-05-29_ndata_is_dead_long_live_ndata/">Naev’s data is now
              stored in a zip file, making contributing easier than ever</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Greatly expanded galaxy, including a new faction, Za’lek</li>
            <li>Activated outfits get hotkeys by default</li>
            <li>Fuel is now provided for free at spaceports</li>
            <li>Improved keyboard-and-mouse gameplay, with an optional WASD layout</li>
            <li>Auto-braking (Ctrl-S by default) in lieu of a dedicated Active Cooldown key</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Additionally there’s a slew of minor improvements, tweaks, new missions and the like
          for your enjoyment. As this is a beta release, we’re hoping to iron out any remaining
          issues, particularly with missions and other scripted content. If you run into any issues
          while playing, please report bugs and issues at our <a href=
          "https://github.com/naev/naev/issues">issue tracker</a> or drop by our IRC channel (RIP
          Freenode).</p>
          <p>Right now, we have builds available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, both 32-bit and
          64-bit.</p>
          <p>Lastly, one small note for those compiling from source: While Naev nominally supports
          SDL 2, several important things don’t function properly, like modifier keys and the mouse
          wheel, and error logging on Windows. We’re aiming to sort this out before 0.6.0 stable,
          but we advise players to stick with SDL 1.2 for the time being.</p>

          live ndata</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BTAXIS, ON MAY 29TH, 2014</p>
          <p>So here’s a recent development that may interest some of you out there. As you may
          know, Naev’s game data (sounds, images, script files, etc) comes packaged in an archive
          called ndata when you download a stable version. It’s a simple thing, little more than a
          concatenation of the files, but the trouble with it was that we were using our own
          format. This made it rather annoying to do anything with it other than just play the
          game.</p>
          <p>As of today, ndata’s format has changed, thanks to nloewen. It is now an uncompressed
          zip archive. This format is ubiquitous and supported by everything and its uncle, so it
          is now much easier to get at the data files themselves when downloading a stable release.
          The main upside to this is that people who are interested in how the game works, or in
          changing parts of the game can directly start tinkering without the need to re-download
          the data files from git.</p>
          <p>It’s a small change that doesn’t affect the game itself, but I’m happy to see the
          switch finally made.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">BY BTAXIS, ON MAY 20TH, 2014</p>
          <p>Hello everyone, here’s an update about the state of affairs surrounding Naev. I know,
          right? Yes, it’s been almost two years since our last post. You might think that that
          means little or nothing has been happening with the project, and mostly this is true, but
          not entirely.</p>
          <p>Let’s start with the thing that prompted this post in the first place. A great man
          once said:</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "“One does not simply get greenlit on Steam.”" src=
            "../../imgs/blarg/2014/05/boromir-One-does-not-simply-walk-into-Mordor.jpg"></div>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
              “One does not simply get greenlit on Steam.”
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>But, as we all know, Sean tends to be wrong about these things. As a matter of fact,
          <strong>Naev has been officially greenlit</strong>. This came as something as a surprise,
          since although people did occasionally comment and vote on the <a href=
          "https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=93971156&amp;tscn=1400016324">Greenlight
          page</a> it was by no means a hive of activity. But there you have it. Needless to say
          this is good news indeed.</p>
          <p>In other news, work has been going into the core slots system that currently only
          exists in the development version. The system is described in earlier posts, and Deiz has
          been improving the core outfit definitions. You can view <a href=
          "https://web.archive.org/web/20170730021511/http://wiki.naev.org/wiki/Core_slots_balancing_2">
          his notes</a> on the wiki. Once that is finished we’re hoping to get the game ready for a
          new release numbered 0.6.0. We may yet run into issues that have to be resolved first,
          but we’d really like to get a new release out the door in hopes of rekindling interest in
          the project. Fingers crossed!</p>
          <p>There has also been some discussion recently about the relationship between armour and
          shields within the game. There is some <a href=
          "https://web.archive.org/web/20170730021150/http://wiki.naev.org/wiki/Armour_Revamp">writing
          about that</a> on the wiki as well. It should be noted that this is not a proposal or
          anything we plan to do, at this point we haven’t decided on any course of action and the
          floor remains open for debate.</p>
          <p>Other than that a whole slew of minor corrections and content has also been constantly
          creeping in from a lot of different people. We hope this will make the experience
          smoother and more enjoyable for everyone.</p>
          <p>That’s it for now. Let’s hope there won’t be too much time until the next blog
          post.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">BY BTAXIS, ON AUGUST 19TH, 2012</p>
          <p>Hello readers, it’s been a long time since our last post. I hope you’re both doing
          well.</p>
          <p>Development has been pretty slow in the last months. It hasn’t entirely ceased though,
          and today I can tell you that a pretty major change to the game has been finalized and is
          now in the master git branch. The way ships work has been changed, and that’s what most
          of this post is going to be about. There have also been some other changes I’ll briefly
          mention at the end. Hang tight, it’s going to be a long one.</p>
          <h4 id="slots-refinement">Slots refinement</h4>
          <p>The basis of the new system is a refinement of the ship slots. Up until now, ships had
          three types of slots: utility, structure and weapons. This is true even now, but it is
          now also possible for slots to be specialized. We can demand an outfit be installed in a
          certain specialized slot, and we can enforce that specialized slots can only take certain
          outfits. This allows us to gear certain ships to certain roles, and that will be
          important later when we deal with fleets.</p>
          <p>For example, imagine a Carrier class ship. This ship might have a number of
          specialized slots that will only take fighter bays. We can also create special fighter
          bay outfits to go in these slots that are better (lighter, higher capacity, less CPU,
          etc) than the fighter bays you can install in any slot. This means that a Carrier has
          much greater potential for carrying fighters than a Cruiser of equivalent size.</p>
          <p>One size will no longer fit all, in the future.</p>
          <h4 id="ship-core-equipment">Ship core equipment</h4>
          <p>Currently our most important (in fact only) use of the new slot system is found in
          every ship in the game.</p>
          <p>Up until now, you’ve known your ships by their abilities. Some ships were faster, some
          slower, some had more energy in the tank, some had more CPU to spend. With this new
          mechanic, that has changed completely. With a few exceptions, ships have been stripped of
          all their numbers. Instead, these numbers are granted by certain special equipment
          installed on the ship. This special equipment we call “core outfits”, or more briefly,
          cores.</p>
          <p>Each ship has three “core slots”: one for its engines, one for its core systems, and
          one for its hull mod. Every ship can only equip one single outfit of each kind, and each
          ship MUST have one of each kind installed, or the ship will not fly! The interpretation
          of each core outfit type is as follows:</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "A ship with its core slots installed. The orange text in the tool tip indicates the slot specialization."
            src="../../imgs/blarg/2012/08/coreslots.png"></div>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
              A ship with its core slots installed. The orange text in the tool tip indicates the
              slot specialization.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Engine</strong> core slots are just that, the ship’s engines. Engines
            determine how fast a ship can accelerate, the ship’s maximum speed, the base fuel
            capacity, and the mass limit (more on this one below).</li>
            <li><strong>System</strong> core slots can be thought of as the heart of the ship.
            Systems determine energy generation and capacity, shield generation and capacity, as
            well as CPU capacity.</li>
            <li><strong>Hull</strong> core slots represent the structural configuration of the
            entire ship. Most importantly hull cores affect armour, damage absorption and cargo
            space, but some hulls can do other things as well, such as make a ship more stealthy or
            increase energy regeneration. Hull mods also greatly contribute to a ship’s mass.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Of course, there is a healthy variety of all core types available. When you buy a ship
          it will come with very low end cores, so you’ll have to invest to increase your ship’s
          performance!</p>
          <h4 id="ship-stats">Ship stats</h4>
          <p>Hang on, I hear you saying. If all ships now take their performance values from cores,
          doesn’t that mean all ships are the same if you install the same cores in them? Why yes,
          that would be the case if we just kept it at this. But no, there’s more.</p>
          <p>Where every ship was the sum of its values before, it now is (mostly) the sum of its
          ship stats. Ship stats are modifiers specific to that ship. For example, a ship might
          have a 15% bonus to energy generation. This means that whatever energy regeneration is
          granted by its outfits will be multiplied by 1.15. This makes it attractive to install a
          good system core, and maybe extra energy generators as well. On the other hand, a ship
          might have a penalty to its maximum speed. This means that engines you mount on the ship
          will have reduced performance. So, even if you use the same core outfits, two different
          ships might well behave very differently.</p>
          <p>Ship stats are usually scalars like that, but they can do other things as well. For
          example, there is a ship stat that enables a ship to jump through a jump point without
          having to brake and charge up its hyperdrive first! A ship with this ship stat will make
          hyperjumps a lot easier.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "A ship with its core slots installed. The orange text in the tool tip indicates the slot specialization."
            src="../../imgs/blarg/2012/08/shipstats.png"></div>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
              A ship with its core slots installed. The orange text in the tool tip indicates the
              slot specialization.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Now, perhaps confusingly, it is possible for outfits to grant ship stats to a ship.
          This seems illogical (they are called SHIP stats, after all), but it is very useful
          because it allows us to make outfits that grant ships special abilities, while ALSO
          allowing ships to come with those special abilities out of the box. For example, there is
          a “Reverse Thrusters” ship stat that allows ships to thrust backwards – when you press
          the reverse key, the ship will slow down instead of turning around, and eventually fly
          backwards. This ability might be standard on a certain class of fighters, but it’s also
          possible for pilots to mount an outfit on their ship that gives them the same thing, if
          they’re willing to spend a slot on it.</p>
          <h4 id="mass-limit">Mass limit</h4>
          <p>I’ve written up the basics of the new slots system now, but this is one thing I want
          to explain in more detail.</p>
          <p>First, let’s examine this “mass limit” that I mentioned earlier in this post. It’s a
          new concept that didn’t exist in the game before. Every engine has a mass limit value,
          for example 100. This value determines the maximum mass the engine can support at maximum
          efficiency. If the ship becomes heavier than this limit, the engine isn’t capable of
          pulling all that weight anymore and the ship will become slower and more sluggish. The
          mass acts as a divisor for the engine’s efficiency, such that when the ship is twice as
          heavy as the mass limit, the engine will only function half as well.</p>
          <p>Now, you might feel that this mass limit thing is an arbitrary limitation, and it is.
          Let me explain why it exists. You see, it leads back to the issue of ships behaving the
          same if the same outfits are installed. It is entirely possible for capital ships to
          install fighter engines, because the slot system allows you to install outfits into any
          slot that is at least big enough. Obviously, we don’t want capital ships to race around
          like fighters though! So we need to make sure that capital ships benefit most from
          capital ship engines. The way to do it is, of course, by adding mass to the equation. At
          the same time, we want to make sure that the BIG engines are capable of pushing the big
          ships around, which raises the question of how to balance that. You can just give big
          engines a lot of output to compensate for the ship’s mass, but that would mean the engine
          is always a lot worse than it says on the tin, and that’s not fun for the player. So
          instead, I chose to arbitrarily define a maximum mass at which the engine is guaranteed
          to perform optimally. This is easier to work with on the balancing side of things.</p>
          <h4 id="other-changes">Other changes</h4>
          <p>The following is a list of changes made that don’t directly relate to the slots
          system. I probably forgot a few things, though.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fuel consumption has been changed so small ships use 100 fuel per jump, medium
            ships use 200, and large ships use 400. This is done to counteract the fact that larger
            ships have more slots, and can therefore equip more fuel tanks. This gave large ships a
            much greater operational range than small ones. The flipside of this is that buying
            fuel off NPC ships is going to be more tedious, but we have some ideas about easing
            that.</li>
            <li>The Auxiliary Processing Unit outfits no longer exist. Sorry! The only way to
            increase your CPU capacity is by upgrading your core system.</li>
            <li>The galaxy now contains secret shortcut jumps. You can’t find these jumps unless
            you have a special scanner, and even then you probably need some hints to find them.
            Note that the scanner isn’t sold anywhere yet, and there are also no hints to be had
            yet. But this is a work-in-progress.</li>
          </ul>

            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=

          </figure>
          <ul>
            <li>Some work has gone into the equipment screen. The outfit list is now tabbed, each
            tab corresponding to a class of outfits. The tab letters, as seen on the right, stand
            for <strong>W</strong>eapons, <strong>U</strong>tility, <strong>S</strong>tructure,
            <strong>C</strong>ore and <strong>X</strong>everything. Hopefully, this can be further
            improved and applied to the outfitter screen as well. 
            <!-- codespell:ignore ore,tructure --></li>
            <li>For developers: All game data is now found under the dat/ subdirectory. This was
            done to make the relationship between the game data and the ndata file more
            apparent.</li>
            <li>For developers: Lua scripts from the dat/scripts/ subdirectory can now be included
            into other scripts by only their name. The game will look in this directory for
            includes.</li>
