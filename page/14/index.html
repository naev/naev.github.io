          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2012-02-20_xdg_part_deux/">XDG Part Deux</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY DEIZ, ON FEBRUARY 20TH, 2012</p>
          <p>As with the previous post, this pertains solely to <strong>*nix</strong> (primarily
          Linux and Mac OS X) users. Windows users are warned to avert their eyes to avoid
          irreversible Unixification.</p>
          <p>I’m not a fan of pushing maintenance duty onto end-users, so I’ve done some work to
          automate the XDG configuration update process bobbens mentioned.</p>
          <p>When first running the next release, if old configuration files exist (in ye olde
          ~/.naev) a prompt will show up, offering to automatically invoke the update script. This
          will hopefully reduce the process down to simply clicking “Yes” for most users.</p>
          <p>Of course, you’re welcome to click “No”, as well. To hopefully handle all distribution
          cases (whether Naev is run from loose files in a Git checkout, installed via a package
          manager or grabbed directly from SourceForge) the script is both included in the
          single-file ndata and available as a standalone file.</p>
          <p>With any luck, the configuration update will be smooth and painless. It should also
          make the coming release less painful for bobbens, because I think if we’d gone the
          full-manual route and asked package maintainers to correctly run the script for each
          user, they’d be demanding his head on a pike.</p>

          Compliancy</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON FEBRUARY 19TH, 2012</p>
          <p>This change only affects <strong>UNIX</strong> platforms (that includes linux and mac
          os x). Now in git master we have recently merged changes that should bring Naev up to the
          <a href=
          "https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html">XDG Base
          Directory specification</a>. What does this mean? First off it means that no longer will
          Naev’s per user stuff sit in “~/.naev” but instead it will be split up so that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>config is in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or “~/.config/naev”</li>
            <li>saves and screenshots are in $XDG_DATA_HOME or “~/.local/share/naev”</li>
            <li>nebula and misc cache stuff are in $XDG_CACHE_HOME or “~/.cache/naev”</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The bad news, this means that you will have to run our script to move stuff over or it
          won’t recognize your old config or saves. We should be detecting that and displaying a
          warning. To update to the new paths all you have to do is run:</p>
          <p><code>$ ./naev-confupdate.sh</code></p>
          <p>However, we do believe this will be better in the long run. Package maintainers should
          look into incorporating that script for users in post-install hooks or the likes to avoid
          trouble. Sorry for any inconveniences this may cause.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">BY BTAXIS, ON FEBRUARY 11TH, 2012</p>
          <p>Okay, so, on those activated outfits, they’re now up and running in the Git version.
          For those of you who are curious about how it works, I’ll explain it briefly.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "Running a jammer while the afterburner cools down." src=
            "../../imgs/blarg/2012/02/active-300x225.png"></div>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">

          </figure>
          <p>An activated outfit is a piece of equipment that does something when manually
          activated in space. While it’s off it does nothing, but it also doesn’t use any energy.
          On the other hand, once an activated outfit is turned on the benefit it gives is usually
          quite noticeable, and can make a big difference if used right.</p>
          <p>This means that the abilities activated outfits give you are highly situational and
          give you more things to worry about than just fly, point and shoot. In some ways, we are
          moving a little closer to the common skill bar you find in many action RPGs. Like those
          skills, our activated outfits can have a cooldown period too, which means you need to
          wait a certain time before you can use that same outfit again.</p>
          <p>At the moment, we only have two activated outfits, those being the Missile Jammer
          (which slows down missiles close to you) and the Afterburner. But we have plans for quite
          a few other outfits. For example, how about an outfit that instantaneously transports
          your ship to another part of the system, or an outfit that lets you quickly recharge your
          shield at the cost of a big chunk of energy? The possibilities are many.</p>
          <p>Activated outfits will be in the next release.</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2012-01-23_more_happenings/">More happenings</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BTAXIS, ON JANUARY 23RD, 2012</p>
          <p>Hello everyone, and a belated happy 2012. It’s been rather quiet here on the blog, but
          I assure you that’s only because nobody has been posting on it. Elsewhere we’re all still
          tinkering away on the project, and we’re hoping to build toward a new release in the near
          future. Before we can do that though, we need to put the finishing touches on the active
          outfit system. You see, we plan to add outfits you can install on your ship and activate
          once in space for all sorts of effects… Oh, but I can see you’re not very interested in
          that. So, let’s move on to something else that’s been happening:</p>
          <h4 id="asset-and-jump-discovery">Asset and jump discovery</h4>
          <p>Discovering assets (that’s planets and stations) and jump points used to be easy. Jump
          into a system, glance at the system map, voila, they’re all there. But that is changing.
          Just as ships become undetectable if they’re far away from you, so can assets and jump
          points be invisible to you, using much the same mechanics. For an easy example, look at
          the following screencaps:</p>
          <p><strong>NOTE</strong> These screenshots have been lost to time :(</p>
          <p>As you can see, it’s now possible for assets to not be shown on the map until the
          player discovers them. Now, I should point out that most planets tend to be fairly hard
          to miss in a star system, so when you jump into a new system you will usually discover
          all of them immediately, just like it’s always been. The example above isn’t
          representative in that respect – I simply modified the hide values for the purpose of
          showing how it works. However, if the system has high sensor interference (inside the
          nebula, for example), it may be more difficult to find the planets within.</p>
          <p>Space stations tend to be a fair bit smaller than celestial bodies however (yes yes,
          except THAT one). You may have to scout around a system a bit before they appear on the
          map, and if the station actually makes an effort of being inconspicuous (think hidden
          military or pirate bases), you won’t easily find them.</p>
          <p>Jump points, too, are more difficult to detect than your average planet. You usually
          won’t spot any jump points other than the one you entered from when jumping in, which
          means you can’t plot a course to the next unknown system before first finding the way
          there. So how will you know where the jump points are then? Well, you could fly around
          and look for them yourself, but there are a number of things you can do to find them more
          reliably:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Follow other pilots. Especially traders often travel to other systems, and they
            know all the major routes. If you see a trader fly away from a planet, try following
            it. Chances are it will lead you to a jump point.</li>
            <li>Talk to NPCs in the spaceport bars. Not only do NPCs offer you missions sometimes,
            they will also give you helpful information. Some may even offer to update your map
            with locations of assets or jump points if you don’t know them already.</li>
            <li>Buy maps. As of the next version of Naev, the Star Map outfit has been replaced by
            a collection of pre-defined maps. Each map reveals one or more star systems, and may or
            may not reveal jumps and assets belonging to them. Buying a map for the Empire Core,
            for example, will immediately update your map with systems in Empire space, as well as
            the jumps leading from one to the other.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There are also rumors of new, exotic types of jump points, such as hidden jump points
          that can’t be detected without special equipment, known only to a selected few. There
          also seems to be a kind of jump point that can’t be detected at all, and that only be
          used from the other side…</p>
