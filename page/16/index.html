          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2011-10-16_disabling_revamp/">Disabling Revamp</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON OCTOBER 16TH, 2011</p>
          <p>So, this was done a while back; finally getting around to posting about it. Briefly,
          we’ve changed how disabling works: Instead of auto-disabling when a ship reaches 30% base
          armour, you can now take disabling damage. As for how this works, weapons can now deal
          two types of damage: normal and disabling. Disabling damage is only applied when your
          armour is hit, and this increases your disable damage. If the amount of disabling damage
          taken exceeds your current armour, your ship is disabled. This applies to all ships and
          will make it so now you have to outfit to safely disable ships. However, specialized new
          missiles come to the rescue and provide disabling damage so that you don’t have to
          sacrifice shield piercing abilities for your cannons/turrets.</p>
          <p>As a side note, this now means the player’s ship can be disabled. If your ship is
          disabled, you can be boarded, so prepare to see pirates boarding your poor, sad ship and
          looting your hard-earned funds. As a side mechanic, disabled ships do automatically
          recover after a while, so this means clumps of disabled ships won’t accumulate around
          dangerous jump points. There are limits to what they can steal, so don’t worry about
          losing all your credits to a lone pirate. We believe that this will make the game more
          interesting, especially as we introduce more complex mechanics that will interact with
          this.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">BY BTAXIS, ON JULY 24TH, 2011</p>
          <p>It has been some time since you’ve heard from us, so I’m taking it upon myself to give
          you all an idea of what’s going on with Naev.</p>
          <p>The first thing I should mention is that is is summer for Naev, and summer usually
          means a lull in activity. It has to do with lots of other things happening in summer,
          many of them outdoor ones. I think you get the idea.</p>
          <p>That said, things have been happening since the 0.5.0 release. The original plan for
          the next version, 0.5.1, was, and I <a href=
          "https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/naev?date=2011-06-16#l296">quote</a>:</p>
          <p>14:16 bobbens we can do safe lanes</p>
          <p>14:16 bobbens for starters</p>
          <p>14:16 bobbens although I’m not sure on the safe lane stuff how to procede</p> <!-- codespell:ignore procede -->
          <p>14:16 bobbens we can either go safe lane “simple implementation” first</p>
          <p>14:16 bobbens for quick release</p>
          <p>14:16 bobbens or go quadtrees and asteroids first</p>
          <p>14:16 bobbens for a slower crazy release</p>
          <p>Once this discussion was over, we promptly started working on completely different
          things. One of those things is the revised faction standing mechanic, described in a
          <a href="../../blarg/2011-06-20_expanding_on_faction_standing_and_landing/">previous
          blarg post</a>. But there is more.</p>
          <h4 id="disabling">Disabling</h4>
          <p>For instance, work is ongoing on a revised disabling system. Up until 0.5.0, ships
          would become disabled once they sustained enough damage (to be precise, once armour fell
          below 20%), and that was the end of it. However, one of our team members (it was me) felt
          that this was undesirable, and designed something different. Rather than always being
          disabled through damage directly, ships now accrue “stress” damage, which builds up as
          weapons do damage, and falls naturally over time. Once stress damage equals the amount of
          armour the ship still has left, the ship becomes disabled. Assuming the ship is not
          destroyed afterward, it will come back online after a certain amount of time.</p>
          <p>The important part in the above is that stress damage needs to reach the amount of
          armour health left on the ship. The direct implication of this is that ships with low
          health are more easily disabled than ships with high health, without tying the concepts
          of “low” and “high” to the ship’s maximum amount of health. This means that a small ship
          can be reliably disabled without running the risk of destroying it, for example.</p>
          <p>The introduction of stress damage in itself also gives us the opportunity to
          differentiate weapons further. In practice, this means that most weapons will do minimal
          amounts of disable damage, much less than their actual physical damage, so that it’s
          almost impossible to disable a ship before killing it. On the other hand, certain other
          weapons will deal a lot of stress damage and limited amounts of physical damage, so that
          stress damage easily builds up toward the critical level.</p>
          <h4 id="missiles">Missiles</h4>
          <p>One of our current efforts is to make missiles more meaningful while at the same time
          not placing too much emphasis on them. In 0.5.0, most missiles are mostly useless, for
          various reasons. For instance, damage was low and the likelihood of missiles hitting fast
          targets or targets with jammers was rather low. One of our team members (it was me again)
          came up with an alternative missile system that would allow missiles to be more useful
          while hopefully not be too dominating.</p>
          <p>In the new system, a missile weapon must acquire a lock on the target before it can
          fire. To acquire this lock, the target must be kept within the missile lockon area, which
          is an arc in front of the ship for normal launchers and everywhere for turreted
          launchers. The time the launcher takes to lock on depends on the lockon time defined for
          that launcher, and on the level of stealth of the target. As a general rule, small
          targets are more stealthy than bigger ones. So while an interceptor missile might lock on
          to a capital ship very quickly, a heavy torpedo would take a very long time to lock on to
          a fighter. Stealth is further affected by electronic warfare outfits such as passive
          scramblers and, to be implemented, jammers that must be activated and provide a
          short-term boost.</p>
          <p>Once fired, missiles are quite good at finding their targets. Unlike most of the old
          missiles, all missiles now predict where their target is going to be, so unless the
          target can actually outmaneuver the missile, the missile will usually hit. The new
          missiles also do considerably more damage, so being hit by one can be quite painful. The
          aim is that most missiles are optimally suited to a certain class of ship, however,
          dealing too little damage to seriously hurt targets bigger than that and being too slow
          and sluggish to catch faster ones.</p>
          <h4 id="ship-health">Ship health</h4>
          <p>A somewhat minor change, but perhaps worth mentioning here is the overhaul of ship
          health. Where ship armour and shields more or less linearly increased as the ships got
          bigger and heavier, one of our team members (it was me, sorry) felt a different
          philosophy should be followed.</p>
          <p>Small ships now rely mainly on their maneuverability and their shields, as before.
          Their hulls are made out of bread, relatively speaking, so only a few hits will be enough
          to destroy them. Avoiding fire in an engagement is key to survival.</p>
          <p>Big ships have received substantial cuts to their shielding. While they still have
          more shielding in absolute terms than smaller ships, the increase becomes less and less
          as ships get bigger. On the other hand, armour has been drastically increased. The idea
          here is that big ships, as big and lumbering as they are, will run out of shields in most
          serious encounters, but survive on armour for a considerable time after that. When combat
          is over shields will come back up but armour will not. In this manner, capital ships will
          get worn down between engagements, and will eventually have to return to a friendly
          planet or station to make repairs. Of course, this assumes combat will be sporadic and
          intense, as opposed to constant and niggling (as is currently the case!). All in good
          time.</p>
          <p>I should also mention that shield regeneration has been boosted across the board,
          hopefully enough to make the regeneration actually matter in the middle of combat. I’m
          sure we’ll be tweaking that more in the future.</p>
          <h4 id="soromid">Soromid</h4>
          <p>Following contributions of some great ship models by <a href=
          "https://web.archive.org/web/20160820095618/http://forum.naev.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=174">
          Viruk</a>, a new faction has been added to the Naev galaxy. The Soromid already existed
          as a <a href="https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki/The-Soromid">lore writeup</a> previously,
          but now they also own ships, stations and planets. In the future, they will also receive
          their own weapon specialization, and of course their own missions.</p>
          <p>You can see a map of their territory to the right. It is located in the north of the
          galaxy, where previously there were only empty systems. Not anymore!</p>

          on faction standing and landing</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY DEIZ, ON JUNE 20TH, 2011</p>
          <p>To provide a brief overview: In 0.5.1, the landing and faction standing mechanics will
          be changing in a big way. They’re both no longer hard-coded in C, having been moved to
          flexible Lua scripts that can operate differently for each faction.</p>
          <p>Important military outposts and such will now be restricted to factional allies,
          seldom (if ever) accepting bribes, and attaining standing with a faction will require
          campaign missions rather than just killing the faction’s enemies.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img">
              &lt;img class='img-fluid' alt='They don't take kindly to outsiders at Dvaered High
              Command.' src="/imgs/blarg/2011/06/noland-300x225.png" /&gt;

            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
              They don't take kindly to outsiders at Dvaered High Command.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h4 id="landing">Landing</h4>
          <p>Landing has long been a rather simple mechanic in Naev. Plainly, being neutral or
          friendly with a faction means you can land on any of their assets — up to, and including,
          their primary military and political headquarters. Likewise, if you’re hostile with a
          faction, you can simply bribe your way into the spaceport.</p>
          <p>Yet somehow, it seems that high-ranking bureaucrats and military officers might frown
          on enemies of the state traipsing around their headquarters after throwing a few credits
          at the landing control officer. As such, it’s become a priority to do away with the
          overly-simplistic permission system.</p>
          <p>Our new mechanic for this is rather more nuanced. As we’ve done with many things,
          landing is now handled through Lua — the behaviour is no longer hard-coded in C. The
          simplistic landable-if-not-hostile model has been replaced with a ternary system that can
          operate differently per-faction: while civilian worlds will let neutral strangers land,
          important factional outposts will typically be restricted to allies. Correspondingly, a
          backwater civilian settlement that you’re hostile with is likely to turn a blind eye if
          you pay them off, while officers at a military outpost will tend to be far less
          lenient.</p>
          <p>The restricted assets are also divided into tiers. While an outsider will be able to
          land at most of a faction’s military assets after doing a number of missions for them,
          key assets such as faction home worlds will remain off-limits to all but close
          allies.</p>
          <h4 id="standing">Standing</h4>
          <p>A second, closely-related mechanic is faction standing. Like landing, it’s also far
          from optimal in 0.5.0 and earlier — you can become a faction’s trusted ally simply by
          going on a brief rampage and killing off a number of their enemies’ ships.</p>
          <p>This may even happen inadvertently through normal gameplay. It’s a given that players
          are attacked by pirates in many areas of the galaxy, and since pirates are a common enemy
          among many of the lawful factions, simply fighting off pirates ingratiates players with
          all of these factions.</p>
          <p>For 0.5.1, it’s undergoing a substantial revamp. Like landing, the previously
          hard-coded behaviour has been replaced with a flexible Lua solution. Generally, killing
          alone won’t take you terribly far. To become an ally of a faction, it will be necessary
          to do missions for them.</p>
          <p>Grunt-work such as cargo ferrying and patrol missions won’t go all the way, either.
          Each faction has two ceilings on standing. The first is the point at which killing stops
          increasing your standing, and the other is the limit on how far normal missions can raise
          it.</p>
          <p>To become a faction’s ally, you’ll need to do campaign missions for them. The
          reputation limit that regular missions can reach will be increased by the campaign
          missions, essentially representing an increased willingness for the faction to trust
          you.</p>
          <p>The way reputation is gained through killing is also changing. The 0.5.0 reputation
          system is essentially omniscient. If you kill a pirate out in the middle of nowhere with
          no witnesses, your standing will still go up with all pirate enemies.</p>
          <p>The new system operates on two levels. Killing a faction’s enemies in systems that the
          faction inhabits will trigger a normal standing increase, because you’re directly
          defending them and their populace. The other case is where you’re fighting a faction’s
          enemies outside of the faction’s space. In this instance, killing a faction’s enemies
          only increases your standing if the faction has a ship that’s within sensor range.</p>
          <p>Plainly put, a faction should only take notice if your actions affect them in a direct
          manner. The Empire shouldn’t care if you kill a pirate deep within Sirius space, nor vice
          versa.</p>
          <p>We hope that these mechanics will make general faction relationships more compelling,
          and ideally they will serve to distinguish factions from each other, rather than faction
          standing polarizing into lawful versus lawless, with one group of factions at 100% and
          the other at -100%.</p>
          <p>The Naev devteam is proud to announce the release of Naev 0.5.0! This release is the
          result of over a year of hard work done by nearly 30 committers. This release is just a
          step in the path for ultimate greatness and a major step forward in the maturity of Naev.
          It has many major gameplay changes and signifies the coming of age of Naev, which has now
          exceeded the tag of Escape Velocity clone.</p>

          result of over a year of hard work done by nearly 30 committers. This release is just a
          step in the path for ultimate greatness and a major step forward in the maturity of Naev.
          It has many major gameplay changes and signifies the coming of age of Naev, which has now
          exceeded the tag of Escape Velocity clone.</p>

          <p>Due to the size of the 0.5.0 ndata, downloads shall from now on be hosted at
          Sourceforge instead of Google Code due to the latter’s arbitrary size limits.The rest of
          the project infrastructure will remain unchanged.</p>
          <p>In the future, a shorter release cycle will be used, with focus on the remaining
          features left before content can be the main focus which include asteroids, dynamic
          economy and fleet AI, among others.</p>
          <p>Some statistics of the release to give an idea of the magnitude: 961 files changed,
          91734 insertions(+), 25431 deletions(-)</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2011-05-18_openal_showcase/">OpenAL showcase</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON MAY 18TH, 2011</p>
          <p>With 0.5.0-beta2 out the door I decided to work on more videos to show off missions
          and fancy things we do in Naev. I first decided to record the OpenAL effects (EFX) we do
          in the nebula. For this I decided to show off the “Destroy the FLF base” mission. If you
          do not want to be partially spoiled I recommend you do not watch the video. Although it
          is really cool.</p>
          <p>Effects to notice:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Positional sound (basic for OpenAL)</li>
            <li>Doppler Effect (depends on velocity)</li>
            <li>Air absorption factor (sounds like you’re under water)</li>
            <li>Reverb (also helps make it sound like you’re underwater)</li>
            <li>Speed of sound changes (depends on nebula density – also for sounding
            underwater)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For the implementation I’m using the <a href="https://openal-soft.org/">SW OpenAL
          implementation by KittyCat</a>. Which should work on all systems that support Naev, so I
          highly recommend it. With the SDL_Mixer backend you do not get all these fancy effects.
          Some of these effects are also active when not in the nebula and especially notable is
          the pitch shift with time compression. So I highly recommend you all use the OpenAL
          backend.</p>
          <p>Now without further ado here is the showcase video of the mission:</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive video720p">
            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3 figure-img">
              <video controls="" class="embed-responsive-item"><source src=
              "../../videos/blarg/2011/05/0.5.0_flfbase.webm" type=
              'video/webm;codecs="vp9, opus"'></video>
            </div>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
              FLF Base showcase video
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>I’m not an OpenAL expert, so if anybody has any advice or recommendations, I’d love to
          hear them. This isn’t final so it may sound different in the 0.5.0 release. Of course I
          haven’t touched this part of the sound code in 2 years or so. We’ll see.</p>
          <p>(Sorry for the 4:3 resolution also, I promise I won’t do it again)</p>
