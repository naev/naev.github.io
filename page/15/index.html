          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2012-03-01_0.5.1/">Naev 0.5.1 Release</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON MARCH 1ST, 2012</p>
          <p>The Naev development team is proud to announce the release of Naev 0.5.1. It’s been
          nearly nine months since the release of 0.5.0, but we hope the release is worth the wait.
          With contributions by some twenty people, it’s one of our larger releases.</p>
          <p>0.5.1 was originally intended to be a small feature release, released soon after
          0.5.0. Needless to say, that didn’t happen. However, in the time since, 0.5.1 has
          ballooned into a sizeable release unto itself. We’ve implemented a number of proposals
          that bring us a few steps closer to our goal for the far-off version 1.0, developed a
          fair bit of new content, and polished up innumerable things.</p>
          <p>As per usual, we encourage players to start new pilots in 0.5.1 for an optimal
          experience. Of course, older saves can still be loaded, but there are some caveats.
          Specifically, due to asset and jump discovery, a 0.5.0 (or earlier) save will have its
          map appear as a series of unlinked systems, as the jumps must be discovered. A number of
          older missions have also been heavily tweaked, so in-progress missions in older saves may
          need to be manually aborted.</p>
          <p>And now, for some slightly-misleading statistics, from 0.5.0 up to a few days ago:</p>
          <p>804 files changed, 48017 insertions(+), 35760 deletions(-)</p>
          <p>As well as some less-misleading ones, from the src/ directory:</p>
          <p>346 files changed, 14799 insertions(+), 8806 deletions(-)</p>
          <p>Since 0.5.0, Naev’s core code has grown by almost 6,000 lines, and we’ve gained more
          than 12,000 lines, in total.</p>

              </ul>

              <ul>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2012-02-20_xdg_part_deux/">XDG Part Deux</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY DEIZ, ON FEBRUARY 20TH, 2012</p>
          <p>As with the previous post, this pertains solely to <strong>*nix</strong> (primarily
          Linux and Mac OS X) users. Windows users are warned to avert their eyes to avoid
          irreversible Unixification.</p>
          <p>I’m not a fan of pushing maintenance duty onto end-users, so I’ve done some work to
          automate the XDG configuration update process bobbens mentioned.</p>
          <p>When first running the next release, if old configuration files exist (in ye olde
          ~/.naev) a prompt will show up, offering to automatically invoke the update script. This
          will hopefully reduce the process down to simply clicking “Yes” for most users.</p>
          <p>Of course, you’re welcome to click “No”, as well. To hopefully handle all distribution
          cases (whether Naev is run from loose files in a Git checkout, installed via a package
          manager or grabbed directly from SourceForge) the script is both included in the
          single-file ndata and available as a standalone file.</p>
          <p>With any luck, the configuration update will be smooth and painless. It should also
          make the coming release less painful for bobbens, because I think if we’d gone the
          full-manual route and asked package maintainers to correctly run the script for each
          user, they’d be demanding his head on a pike.</p>

          Compliancy</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON FEBRUARY 19TH, 2012</p>
          <p>This change only affects <strong>UNIX</strong> platforms (that includes linux and mac
          os x). Now in git master we have recently merged changes that should bring Naev up to the
          <a href=
          "https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html">XDG Base
          Directory specification</a>. What does this mean? First off it means that no longer will
          Naev’s per user stuff sit in “~/.naev” but instead it will be split up so that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>config is in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or “~/.config/naev”</li>
            <li>saves and screenshots are in $XDG_DATA_HOME or “~/.local/share/naev”</li>
            <li>nebula and misc cache stuff are in $XDG_CACHE_HOME or “~/.cache/naev”</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The bad news, this means that you will have to run our script to move stuff over or it
          won’t recognize your old config or saves. We should be detecting that and displaying a
          warning. To update to the new paths all you have to do is run:</p>
          <p><code>$ ./naev-confupdate.sh</code></p>
          <p>However, we do believe this will be better in the long run. Package maintainers should
          look into incorporating that script for users in post-install hooks or the likes to avoid
          trouble. Sorry for any inconveniences this may cause.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">BY BTAXIS, ON FEBRUARY 11TH, 2012</p>
          <p>Okay, so, on those activated outfits, they’re now up and running in the Git version.
          For those of you who are curious about how it works, I’ll explain it briefly.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "Running a jammer while the afterburner cools down." src=
            "../../imgs/blarg/2012/02/active-300x225.png"></div>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">

          </figure>
          <p>An activated outfit is a piece of equipment that does something when manually
          activated in space. While it’s off it does nothing, but it also doesn’t use any energy.
          On the other hand, once an activated outfit is turned on the benefit it gives is usually
          quite noticeable, and can make a big difference if used right.</p>
          <p>This means that the abilities activated outfits give you are highly situational and
          give you more things to worry about than just fly, point and shoot. In some ways, we are
          moving a little closer to the common skill bar you find in many action RPGs. Like those
          skills, our activated outfits can have a cooldown period too, which means you need to
          wait a certain time before you can use that same outfit again.</p>
          <p>At the moment, we only have two activated outfits, those being the Missile Jammer
          (which slows down missiles close to you) and the Afterburner. But we have plans for quite
          a few other outfits. For example, how about an outfit that instantaneously transports
          your ship to another part of the system, or an outfit that lets you quickly recharge your
          shield at the cost of a big chunk of energy? The possibilities are many.</p>
          <p>Activated outfits will be in the next release.</p>
