          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2012-08-19_slots_branch_merged/">Slots branch merged</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BTAXIS, ON AUGUST 19TH, 2012</p>
          <p>Hello readers, it’s been a long time since our last post. I hope you’re both doing
          well.</p>
          <p>Development has been pretty slow in the last months. It hasn’t entirely ceased though,
          and today I can tell you that a pretty major change to the game has been finalized and is
          now in the master git branch. The way ships work has been changed, and that’s what most
          of this post is going to be about. There have also been some other changes I’ll briefly
          mention at the end. Hang tight, it’s going to be a long one.</p>
          <h4 id="slots-refinement">Slots refinement</h4>
          <p>The basis of the new system is a refinement of the ship slots. Up until now, ships had
          three types of slots: utility, structure and weapons. This is true even now, but it is
          now also possible for slots to be specialized. We can demand an outfit be installed in a
          certain specialized slot, and we can enforce that specialized slots can only take certain
          outfits. This allows us to gear certain ships to certain roles, and that will be
          important later when we deal with fleets.</p>
          <p>For example, imagine a Carrier class ship. This ship might have a number of
          specialized slots that will only take fighter bays. We can also create special fighter
          bay outfits to go in these slots that are better (lighter, higher capacity, less CPU,
          etc) than the fighter bays you can install in any slot. This means that a Carrier has
          much greater potential for carrying fighters than a Cruiser of equivalent size.</p>
          <p>One size will no longer fit all, in the future.</p>
          <h4 id="ship-core-equipment">Ship core equipment</h4>
          <p>Currently our most important (in fact only) use of the new slot system is found in
          every ship in the game.</p>
          <p>Up until now, you’ve known your ships by their abilities. Some ships were faster, some
          slower, some had more energy in the tank, some had more CPU to spend. With this new
          mechanic, that has changed completely. With a few exceptions, ships have been stripped of
          all their numbers. Instead, these numbers are granted by certain special equipment
          installed on the ship. This special equipment we call “core outfits”, or more briefly,
          cores.</p>
          <p>Each ship has three “core slots”: one for its engines, one for its core systems, and
          one for its hull mod. Every ship can only equip one single outfit of each kind, and each
          ship MUST have one of each kind installed, or the ship will not fly! The interpretation
          of each core outfit type is as follows:</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "A ship with its core slots installed. The orange text in the tool tip indicates the slot specialization."
            src="../../imgs/blarg/2012/08/coreslots.png"></div>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
              A ship with its core slots installed. The orange text in the tool tip indicates the
              slot specialization.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Engine</strong> core slots are just that, the ship’s engines. Engines
            determine how fast a ship can accelerate, the ship’s maximum speed, the base fuel
            capacity, and the mass limit (more on this one below).</li>
            <li><strong>System</strong> core slots can be thought of as the heart of the ship.
            Systems determine energy generation and capacity, shield generation and capacity, as
            well as CPU capacity.</li>
            <li><strong>Hull</strong> core slots represent the structural configuration of the
            entire ship. Most importantly hull cores affect armour, damage absorption and cargo
            space, but some hulls can do other things as well, such as make a ship more stealthy or
            increase energy regeneration. Hull mods also greatly contribute to a ship’s mass.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Of course, there is a healthy variety of all core types available. When you buy a ship
          it will come with very low end cores, so you’ll have to invest to increase your ship’s
          performance!</p>
          <h4 id="ship-stats">Ship stats</h4>
          <p>Hang on, I hear you saying. If all ships now take their performance values from cores,
          doesn’t that mean all ships are the same if you install the same cores in them? Why yes,
          that would be the case if we just kept it at this. But no, there’s more.</p>
          <p>Where every ship was the sum of its values before, it now is (mostly) the sum of its
          ship stats. Ship stats are modifiers specific to that ship. For example, a ship might
          have a 15% bonus to energy generation. This means that whatever energy regeneration is
          granted by its outfits will be multiplied by 1.15. This makes it attractive to install a
          good system core, and maybe extra energy generators as well. On the other hand, a ship
          might have a penalty to its maximum speed. This means that engines you mount on the ship
          will have reduced performance. So, even if you use the same core outfits, two different
          ships might well behave very differently.</p>
          <p>Ship stats are usually scalars like that, but they can do other things as well. For
          example, there is a ship stat that enables a ship to jump through a jump point without
          having to brake and charge up its hyperdrive first! A ship with this ship stat will make
          hyperjumps a lot easier.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "A ship with its core slots installed. The orange text in the tool tip indicates the slot specialization."
            src="../../imgs/blarg/2012/08/shipstats.png"></div>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
              A ship with its core slots installed. The orange text in the tool tip indicates the
              slot specialization.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Now, perhaps confusingly, it is possible for outfits to grant ship stats to a ship.
          This seems illogical (they are called SHIP stats, after all), but it is very useful
          because it allows us to make outfits that grant ships special abilities, while ALSO
          allowing ships to come with those special abilities out of the box. For example, there is
          a “Reverse Thrusters” ship stat that allows ships to thrust backwards – when you press
          the reverse key, the ship will slow down instead of turning around, and eventually fly
          backwards. This ability might be standard on a certain class of fighters, but it’s also
          possible for pilots to mount an outfit on their ship that gives them the same thing, if
          they’re willing to spend a slot on it.</p>
          <h4 id="mass-limit">Mass limit</h4>
          <p>I’ve written up the basics of the new slots system now, but this is one thing I want
          to explain in more detail.</p>
          <p>First, let’s examine this “mass limit” that I mentioned earlier in this post. It’s a
          new concept that didn’t exist in the game before. Every engine has a mass limit value,
          for example 100. This value determines the maximum mass the engine can support at maximum
          efficiency. If the ship becomes heavier than this limit, the engine isn’t capable of
          pulling all that weight anymore and the ship will become slower and more sluggish. The
          mass acts as a divisor for the engine’s efficiency, such that when the ship is twice as
          heavy as the mass limit, the engine will only function half as well.</p>
          <p>Now, you might feel that this mass limit thing is an arbitrary limitation, and it is.
          Let me explain why it exists. You see, it leads back to the issue of ships behaving the
          same if the same outfits are installed. It is entirely possible for capital ships to
          install fighter engines, because the slot system allows you to install outfits into any
          slot that is at least big enough. Obviously, we don’t want capital ships to race around
          like fighters though! So we need to make sure that capital ships benefit most from
          capital ship engines. The way to do it is, of course, by adding mass to the equation. At
          the same time, we want to make sure that the BIG engines are capable of pushing the big
          ships around, which raises the question of how to balance that. You can just give big
          engines a lot of output to compensate for the ship’s mass, but that would mean the engine
          is always a lot worse than it says on the tin, and that’s not fun for the player. So
          instead, I chose to arbitrarily define a maximum mass at which the engine is guaranteed
          to perform optimally. This is easier to work with on the balancing side of things.</p>
          <h4 id="other-changes">Other changes</h4>
          <p>The following is a list of changes made that don’t directly relate to the slots
          system. I probably forgot a few things, though.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fuel consumption has been changed so small ships use 100 fuel per jump, medium
            ships use 200, and large ships use 400. This is done to counteract the fact that larger
            ships have more slots, and can therefore equip more fuel tanks. This gave large ships a
            much greater operational range than small ones. The flipside of this is that buying
            fuel off NPC ships is going to be more tedious, but we have some ideas about easing
            that.</li>
            <li>The Auxiliary Processing Unit outfits no longer exist. Sorry! The only way to
            increase your CPU capacity is by upgrading your core system.</li>
            <li>The galaxy now contains secret shortcut jumps. You can’t find these jumps unless
            you have a special scanner, and even then you probably need some hints to find them.
            Note that the scanner isn’t sold anywhere yet, and there are also no hints to be had
            yet. But this is a work-in-progress.</li>
          </ul>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <ul>
            <li>Some work has gone into the equipment screen. The outfit list is now tabbed, each
            tab corresponding to a class of outfits. The tab letters, as seen on the right, stand
            for <strong>W</strong>eapons, <strong>U</strong>tility, <strong>S</strong>tructure,
            <strong>C</strong>ore and <strong>X</strong>everything. Hopefully, this can be further
            improved and applied to the outfitter screen as well. 
            <!-- codespell:ignore ore,tructure --></li>
            <li>For developers: All game data is now found under the dat/ subdirectory. This was
            done to make the relationship between the game data and the ndata file more
            apparent.</li>
            <li>For developers: Lua scripts from the dat/scripts/ subdirectory can now be included
            into other scripts by only their name. The game will look in this directory for
            includes.</li>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2012-04-15_0.5.3/">Naev 0.5.3 Release</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY DEIZ, ON APRIL 15TH, 2012</p>
          <p>The Naev development team is proud to announce the release of Naev 0.5.3. This release
          fixes several bugs and introduces a few minor features. We aim for this to be the final
          release in the 0.5.x series, with 0.6.0 following in the not-so-distant future and
          bringing significant changes to ship equipping.</p>
          <p>Perhaps most importantly, we’ve introduced a non-gameplay feature, portable mode. On
          launch, Naev will now look for a file named <a href=
          "https://github.com/naev/naev/blob/v0.5.3/extras/win_installer/datapath.lua">datapath.lua</a>
          in the same directory as the Naev binary. The Windows installer provides this as an
          option, making it easy to install and run Naev from removable media.</p>
          <p>Note that if you want to use portable mode with your existing saves, you’ll need to
          migrate your files manually. For Windows users, this means moving
          <code>%APPDATA%\naev\</code> to <code>naev-data\</code> within the directory Naev is
          installed to.</p>

          Cycle</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON APRIL 7TH, 2012</p>
          <p>Since 0.5.2′s release two weeks ago, a number of bugs have been caught and fixed, and
          several minor features have been implemented. We’ve decided to do another release in the
          short-term (0.5.3) which will hopefully be the last of the 0.5 series.</p>
          <p>Following 0.5.3, our major focus will be implementing and polishing the slots proposal
          (essentially, making a ship’s core systems separately upgradable). This and a number of
          smaller features will be incorporated into 0.6.0.</p>
          <p>Therefore, in order to make sure the last of the 0.5 releases is as bug-free as
          possible, we urge everyone to report any and all issues. Testing with a Git master build
          is preferred, as several issues have been fixed since 0.5.2, but bug reports from 0.5.2
          are welcome. Check the <a href="https://github.com/naev/naev/issues">issue tracker</a> to
          make sure it’s not a duplicate. Safe flying!</p>

          afterburner outfit. Where you could run it continuously so long as your ship had energy
          before, now it can only be on for a certain about of time, after which it needs to
          recharge. Also, in 0.5.2, activating the afterburner will abort the autonav.</p>
          <p>The reasoning behind this is that the afterburner is a combat-oriented outfit, whereas
          most people were using it to speed up their ship during travel, particularly during rush
          missions. Effectively, an afterburner would speed up a ship – a lot – for no appreciable
          cost. This we wanted to discourage. Speed at long ranges should come from speccing for
          speed by going light on weapons and using passive outfits, not from abusing the
          afterburner.</p>
          <p>However, some people raised some legitimate complaints about the changes we made. For
          instance, making the afterburner recharge over the same time period irrespective of how
          long it was on is unpleasant and counter to what you might expect. Aborting the autonav
          was just an added irritation, not an incentive not to use the afterburner. After all,
          afterburning in 1x time would still get you to your destination in less in-game time than
          not using it in time compression would. Finally, limiting the afterburner’s time wasn’t
          really making the afterburner ineffective at speeding up the ship over long distances, it
          was only making it a bit LESS effective.</p>
          <p>Reason for us to tackle the problem from a different angle. The afterburner should not
          be made annoying to use. Instead, it should simply be made unfit for the purposes it
          wasn’t intended for. To do this, we picked up an idea we discussed early in the
          afterburner overhaul: making afterburners generate heat.</p>
          <h4 id="heat-based-afterburners">Heat based afterburners</h4>
          <p>In their latest incarnation, afterburners generate heat when active, in the same way
          weapons generate heat when being fired. And, like weapons, afterburners get less
          effective when they heat up. When the afterburner starts to overheat, the speed and
          thrust bonuses it provides decrease, until afterburning is no faster than regular
          thrusting.</p>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Because heat drains into the ship much slower than it builds up when afterburning, the
          afterburner can’t be on all the time even if energy permits. In fact, for the player it’s
          best to use the afterburner only occasionally and in short bursts. This naturally makes
          it more suitable for use in combat than for speed boosts across large distances.</p>
          <p>The heat based afterburners behave just like the original ones otherwise. They don’t
          have an enforced recharge cycle and can be used at any time, with the sole exception that
          it will shut off automatically when completely overheated, and can only be turned on if
          it’s cooler than 70% of its maximum heat.</p>
          <h4 id="getting-rid-of-heat">Getting rid of heat</h4>
          <p>Afterburners using heat is nice, but it adds another source of heat to a ship that is
          already having to deal with heat from other sources. When a ship’s hull heats up, the
          outfits installed in it won’t cool as fast, or not at all. Especially in combat, this can
          be a big problem – both for the player and the AI. In fact, a fight can degenerate in
          what I call “heat deadlock”, where all parties have heated up so much that their weapons
          aren’t shooting much anymore, so shield regeneration outpaces damage done across the
          board.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>To combat this, we have introduced a new mechanic to the game, called Active Cooldown.
          When in Active Cooldown, a ship very rapidly loses its heat until both hull and outfits
          hit the baseline temperature. The process depends largely on the ship, with small ships
          taking less than 10 seconds to cool and big ships taking around 30. When you consider
          that under normal circumstances, it can literally take hours and hours (real time!) to
          lose heat, Active Cooldown is a very, very fast way to lose heat.</p>
          <p>So, you wonder aloud to nonexistent auditory organs, what’s the catch? There are two
          catches, as it turns out. The first catch is that to enter Active Cooldown, a ship must
          be stationary, and while it is cooling, it can’t take any other action. So in a combat
          situation, Active Cooldown makes you very vulnerable. The second catch is that heat is
          lost at an exponential rate – the longer you wait, the faster heat is lost. This means
          that it is highly desirable to wait until the end of the Active Cooldown cycle, as
          opposed to waiting only a portion of the time and then getting back into action. Active
          Cooldown can’t effectively be “pulsed” to quickly lose some heat in the middle of a
          fight.</p>
          <p>Hopefully, these two changes to gameplay will go a long way in making afterburners the
          tools they’re meant to be without being disruptive to gameplay, as well as making heat
          much less of a problem to prolonged trips through the galaxy.</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2012-03-29_lua_api_docs_added_to_naev_org/">Lua API Docs Added
          to Naev.org</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY DEIZ, ON MARCH 29TH, 2012</p>
          <p>Naev’s Lua API documentation has finally been integrated as a part of <a href=
          "https://naev.org">naev.org</a>, under its very own subdomain: <a href=
          "https://naev.org/api/">api.naev.org</a>.</p>
          <p>Some may note that the documentation has been around for some time, and that’s true.
          In fact, the effort dates to 2008, and has been kept in sync with the code ever since.
          It’s historically been hosted on a small VPS by bobbens, with a handful of links to it
          peppered throughout the <a href="https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki">Wiki</a>, as well as
          a mention in the IRC channel’s topic (RIP Freenode) (though I suspect 95% of IRC users
          never read channel topics).</p>
          <p>With any luck, making the API documentation more easily accessible will spur on some
          mission developers. I’d be remiss if I didn’t reiterate a bit of the API documentation’s
          preamble: Naev includes an in-game Lua console, accessible via <strong>F2</strong>, by
          default. It provides access to the majority of the Lua API (excepting a few things that
          are tied to missions and events, such as the hook module) and is a useful tool for
          ~~cheating~~ testing code snippets for use in missions.</p>
          <p>So, venture forth to Alteris and try something like:</p>
          <p><code>for k,v in ipairs(pilot.get( faction.get("Pirate") )) do v:setHealth(0, 0)
          end</code></p>
          <p>… because as everybody knows, you’re not having fun until you’re surrounded by
          spontaneously-exploding pirates.</p>
