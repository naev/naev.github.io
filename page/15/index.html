          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2011-06-20_expanding_on_faction_standing_and_landing/">Expanding
          on faction standing and landing</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY DEIZ, ON JUNE 20TH, 2011</p>
          <p>To provide a brief overview: In 0.5.1, the landing and faction standing mechanics will
          be changing in a big way. They’re both no longer hard-coded in C, having been moved to
          flexible Lua scripts that can operate differently for each faction.</p>
          <p>Important military outposts and such will now be restricted to factional allies,
          seldom (if ever) accepting bribes, and attaining standing with a faction will require
          campaign missions rather than just killing the faction’s enemies.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img">

              Command.' src="/imgs/blarg/2011/06/noland-300x225.png" /&gt;

          </figure>
          <h4 id="landing">Landing</h4>
          <p>Landing has long been a rather simple mechanic in Naev. Plainly, being neutral or
          friendly with a faction means you can land on any of their assets — up to, and including,
          their primary military and political headquarters. Likewise, if you’re hostile with a
          faction, you can simply bribe your way into the spaceport.</p>
          <p>Yet somehow, it seems that high-ranking bureaucrats and military officers might frown
          on enemies of the state traipsing around their headquarters after throwing a few credits
          at the landing control officer. As such, it’s become a priority to do away with the
          overly-simplistic permission system.</p>
          <p>Our new mechanic for this is rather more nuanced. As we’ve done with many things,
          landing is now handled through Lua — the behaviour is no longer hard-coded in C. The
          simplistic landable-if-not-hostile model has been replaced with a ternary system that can
          operate differently per-faction: while civilian worlds will let neutral strangers land,
          important factional outposts will typically be restricted to allies. Correspondingly, a
          backwater civilian settlement that you’re hostile with is likely to turn a blind eye if
          you pay them off, while officers at a military outpost will tend to be far less
          lenient.</p>
          <p>The restricted assets are also divided into tiers. While an outsider will be able to
          land at most of a faction’s military assets after doing a number of missions for them,
          key assets such as faction home worlds will remain off-limits to all but close
          allies.</p>
          <h4 id="standing">Standing</h4>
          <p>A second, closely-related mechanic is faction standing. Like landing, it’s also far
          from optimal in 0.5.0 and earlier — you can become a faction’s trusted ally simply by
          going on a brief rampage and killing off a number of their enemies’ ships.</p>
          <p>This may even happen inadvertently through normal gameplay. It’s a given that players
          are attacked by pirates in many areas of the galaxy, and since pirates are a common enemy
          among many of the lawful factions, simply fighting off pirates ingratiates players with
          all of these factions.</p>
          <p>For 0.5.1, it’s undergoing a substantial revamp. Like landing, the previously
          hard-coded behaviour has been replaced with a flexible Lua solution. Generally, killing
          alone won’t take you terribly far. To become an ally of a faction, it will be necessary
          to do missions for them.</p>
          <p>Grunt-work such as cargo ferrying and patrol missions won’t go all the way, either.
          Each faction has two ceilings on standing. The first is the point at which killing stops
          increasing your standing, and the other is the limit on how far normal missions can raise
          it.</p>
          <p>To become a faction’s ally, you’ll need to do campaign missions for them. The
          reputation limit that regular missions can reach will be increased by the campaign
          missions, essentially representing an increased willingness for the faction to trust
          you.</p>
          <p>The way reputation is gained through killing is also changing. The 0.5.0 reputation
          system is essentially omniscient. If you kill a pirate out in the middle of nowhere with
          no witnesses, your standing will still go up with all pirate enemies.</p>
          <p>The new system operates on two levels. Killing a faction’s enemies in systems that the
          faction inhabits will trigger a normal standing increase, because you’re directly
          defending them and their populace. The other case is where you’re fighting a faction’s
          enemies outside of the faction’s space. In this instance, killing a faction’s enemies
          only increases your standing if the faction has a ship that’s within sensor range.</p>
          <p>Plainly put, a faction should only take notice if your actions affect them in a direct
          manner. The Empire shouldn’t care if you kill a pirate deep within Sirius space, nor vice
          versa.</p>
          <p>We hope that these mechanics will make general faction relationships more compelling,
          and ideally they will serve to distinguish factions from each other, rather than faction
          standing polarizing into lawful versus lawless, with one group of factions at 100% and
          the other at -100%.</p>
          <p>The Naev devteam is proud to announce the release of Naev 0.5.0! This release is the
          result of over a year of hard work done by nearly 30 committers. This release is just a
          step in the path for ultimate greatness and a major step forward in the maturity of Naev.
          It has many major gameplay changes and signifies the coming of age of Naev, which has now
          exceeded the tag of Escape Velocity clone.</p>

          <p>In the future, a shorter release cycle will be used, with focus on the remaining
          features left before content can be the main focus which include asteroids, dynamic

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2011-05-18_openal_showcase/">OpenAL showcase</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON MAY 18TH, 2011</p>
          <p>With 0.5.0-beta2 out the door I decided to work on more videos to show off missions
          and fancy things we do in Naev. I first decided to record the OpenAL effects (EFX) we do
          in the nebula. For this I decided to show off the “Destroy the FLF base” mission. If you
          do not want to be partially spoiled I recommend you do not watch the video. Although it
          is really cool.</p>
          <p>Effects to notice:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Positional sound (basic for OpenAL)</li>
            <li>Doppler Effect (depends on velocity)</li>
            <li>Air absorption factor (sounds like you’re under water)</li>
            <li>Reverb (also helps make it sound like you’re underwater)</li>
            <li>Speed of sound changes (depends on nebula density – also for sounding
            underwater)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For the implementation I’m using the <a href="https://openal-soft.org/">SW OpenAL
          implementation by KittyCat</a>. Which should work on all systems that support Naev, so I
          highly recommend it. With the SDL_Mixer backend you do not get all these fancy effects.
          Some of these effects are also active when not in the nebula and especially notable is
          the pitch shift with time compression. So I highly recommend you all use the OpenAL
          backend.</p>
          <p>Now without further ado here is the showcase video of the mission:</p>

          <p>I’m not an OpenAL expert, so if anybody has any advice or recommendations, I’d love to
          hear them. This isn’t final so it may sound different in the 0.5.0 release. Of course I
          haven’t touched this part of the sound code in 2 years or so. We’ll see.</p>
          <p>(Sorry for the 4:3 resolution also, I promise I won’t do it again)</p>

          <p class="text-muted">BY DEIZ, ON MAY 14TH, 2011</p>
          <p>The Naev devteam is proud to announce the release of Naev 0.5.0-beta2. This is the
          second beta and is closer to a release candidate than a beta. We do not anticipate any
          major issues unlike with 0.5.0-beta1. We prefer to have another beta so the 0.5.0 release
          is rock solid.</p>
          <p>Links are available on the <a href="../../downloads/">downloads page</a>.</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2011-04-02_0.5.0-beta1/">Naev 0.5.0-beta1 released!</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON APRIL 2ND, 2011</p>
          <p>The Naev team is proud to announce the long-awaited 0.5.0-beta1 release. This is a
          beta release and therefore isn’t quite ready for the general public. While it’s highly
          unlikely that it will set your cat on fire and send threatening messages to your family,
          there are no guarantees.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">

          <p>It’s been over a year since 0.4.2, but this is a major step forward in maturity. The
          original intent for 0.5.0 was to work out many of the important low-level features and
          gameplay mechanics to avoid jarring shifts in gameplay in future releases. Feature creep
          being what it is, 0.5.0 has perpetually grown more ambitious over time. We hope to do a
          better job of “release early, release often” after this beta.</p>
          <p>Compared to 0.4.2, Naev 0.5.0 is essentially a new game. While older saves can be
          loaded in 0.5.0-beta1, we highly recommend that players start new games. Many things have
          changed: The galaxy looks quite different, some older missions are absent or have been
          wholly rewritten, and there’s a wealth of new ships and equipment. For the best
          experience, start fresh.</p>
          <p>On a side note, a number of songs in this release are encoded at a lower quality than
          in Git, for size reasons. Google Code has a “technical limitation” of 200 MB per file and
          our current Git ndata size is 214 MB (and growing). We may have to distribute the final
          0.5.0 release through BitTorrent or another hosting service for this reason.</p>
          <p>We don’t expect this release to be perfect (it’s a beta after all), and what we need
          most right now are testers to run through the many 0.4.2-era missions and other content.
          The more testing the beta gets, the better the final release can be. So please, report
          any issues to us via the <a href=
          "https://web.archive.org/web/20170210202130/http://code.google.com/p/naev/issues/list">Google
