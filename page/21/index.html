          effects: Improving screenshots since 2010.</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY DEIZ, ON AUGUST 16TH, 2010</p>
          <p>Space is an immense, largely vacuous void. The ratio of nothingness to interesting
          phenomena is pitifully high. Among even those rare phenomena, the amount perceptible by
          the human eye pales in comparison to wider-wavelength recording combined with false
          colours.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, however, NAEV is a game, not a simulator. It’s a bit boring to fly over
          endless blackness with nothing but stars to keep you company. Ships and large planets,
          while pretty, come and go with alarming rapidity.</p>
          <p>To that end, we’ve endeavoured to make NAEV more visually enticing by implementing
          support for background graphics. In all, there are more than 30 backgrounds, with more to
          come, hopefully. I suppose it’s time to let the pictures do the talking (Note: They’re
          much larger in-game):</p>
          <p><strong>NOTE</strong> The screenshots have been lost to time :(</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2010-08-12_save_the_events/">Save the Events!</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON AUGUST 12TH, 2010</p>
          <p>After a post in the forum reminded me that it’s stupid that events can’t save
          themselves. I have decided to correct that. So finally after ages of having events sort
          of naturally die we have persistent events. Events work different from missions and in
          this aspect too. For an event to be saved you must explicitly tell it to be saved with
          <a href="https://naev.org/api/modules/evt.html#save">evt.save()</a>. This will make it
          save itself. Also added sanity checks, but there is always the danger (unlike with
          missions) that an event goes crazy and can’t complete. The player since he has no control
          over this won’t be able to eliminate it and over time we may have an issue with event
          bloat in save games. Hopefully this won’t happen since I’ve added checks for the common
          cause of events becoming inert, which is not having any hooks.</p>
          <p>Either way I hope having events can lead to a more dynamic universe in the sense that
          some small scripted actions can appear randomly. Something like scientists screaming in
          falling elevators but in outer space. So keep your eyes open for scripted coolness in
          development version (or 0.5.0 when it’s released).</p>

          <p>To complement this blog, we’ve now added <a href=
          "https://github.com/naev/naev/discussions">a forum</a> to the site.</p>
          <p>It’s somewhat bare at the moment, but it should provide a good venue for feedback, and
          it’s certainly a more familiar format for many users who aren’t used to mailing lists and
          IRC channels.</p>
          <p>The observant NAEV players among you may have noticed that the blog and forum logos
          differ from what’s in-game (as of 0.4.2). That’s thanks to Scaatis, and there’s a forum
          thread on the art he’s contributed here: (<strong>NOTE</strong> This linked to the lost
          forums). Typographical geeks may notice that the new logo is in fact an <a href=
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram">ambigram</a>.</p>
          <p>In time we’ll also roll out a proper (non-Google Code) Wiki here on naev.org and
          integrate it with the forum.</p>

          Newsletter Vol. 1</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON JULY 16TH, 2010</p>
          <p>Hello,</p>
          <p>As I’m aware, much of our community isn’t on IRC, so I’ve decided to start a Sporadic
          NAEV Newsletter to try to show off what is going on and what we’re doing these days with
          NAEV. This could be the last and I don’t know when the next will be done, hence
          “sporadic”. Off we go!</p>
          <h4 id="state-of-050">State of 0.5.0</h4>
          <p>As the <a href=
          "https://web.archive.org/web/20111105054741/http://code.google.com/p/naev/wiki/Changelog">
          changelog</a> indicates, we’ve been working on two of the major features of 0.5.0.
          Namely, the all-famous big systems and electronic warfare. Currently development is being
          done off of master to keep that “playable” while we develop separately. There are two
          branches you can check out:</p>
          <p><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/naev/fLRwFQf8D_g">bigsys</a> (Has big
          systems – Last updated in May.)</p>
          <p><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/naev/OtCAr_ArbEM">ewarfare</a> (Has big
          systems and electronic warfare – Cutting edge.)</p>
          <p>The idea is to try to finish electronic warfare and merge ewarfare into bigsys. Then
          merge bigsys into master leaving most of the release done. Afterwards polish and content
          would be added to get a well-rounded epic release.</p>
          <p>Currently there is no ETA for release, but it should be out before the end of this
          year, potentially much sooner depending on available time and volunteers. As with 0.4.0
          there will be one or more beta releases when we’re nearing release completion. The first
          will probably appear when bigsys is merged into master.</p>
          <h4 id="big-systems">Big Systems</h4>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "Flying over a large planet." src="../../imgs/blarg/2010/07/bigplanet.png"></div>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
              Flying over a large planet.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>So what are these famous <a href=
          "https://groups.google.com/d/topic/naev/fLRwFQf8D_g">big systems</a>? Well as the name
          states, it consists of making the current systems much larger. Not just in terms of
          system size, either – Planet and station graphics are now much larger, too. To be able to
          balance the gameplay with larger systems and to add more interesting missions, jump
          points have been added. You can no longer jump in or out from arbitrary points –
          Interstellar travel is done through fixed points. This removes the ability to simply
          outrun your enemies – They’ll sit on the jump point and wait you out. Missions can also
          make use of this, requiring players to bypass blockades, or set up their own.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "Getting ready to jump." src="../../imgs/blarg/2010/07/jumppoint.png"></div>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
              Getting ready to jump.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Another major feature is that now ships really land. They shrink and then disappear
          into the planet’s atmosphere (or station landing bay). This means you can no longer gank
          NPCs while they sit over planets, which adds more realism. Needless to say, NPC pilots
          are also able to take off from planets.</p>
          <p>As big systems is a really big update, a whole bunch of new features have been added
          to round it out. First the universe has been expanded and many more planets have been
          added – Most systems now have several planets. This is now done via the in-game editor
          that appears when developer mode is enabled (–devmode in the console).</p>
          <p>Secondly, the entire spawn system has been overhauled. There is now a governing spawn
          AI for each “presence” of a faction in a system. You define assets that create “presence”
          that bleeds over the map and that will automatically spawn the ships. It is much more
          robust and sane, although until it’s better balanced (and electronic warfare is finished)
          it leads to perpetual, chaotic battles in contested systems.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the entire tech system has been overhauled using labels and groups instead of
          a 0-10 “sophistication” level, which allows for increased diversity among planets.</p>
          <h4 id="outfit-sizes">Outfit Sizes</h4>
          <p>One of the newest features (recently merged into the electronic warfare branch) is the
          concept of <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/naev/LGrumu1RvvY">slot sizes</a>.
          All low, medium and high slots now have a secondary attribute, size. Sizes can be light,
          standard or heavy and indicates how large of an outfit you can mount in a slot. This is
          added as a hard limit because with CPU power being the only true limiter, it was quite
          easy to put fighter bays and huge batteries on small ships, making them nearly impossible
          to fly.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "A Pacifier with a mixture of heavy and standard slots." src=
            "../../imgs/blarg/2010/07/slotsizes.png"></div>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
              A Pacifier with a mixture of heavy and standard slots.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>The slot sizes also allow better differentiation among ships. Which is to say, a
          fighter with six light high slots can’t come close to matching the firepower of a cruiser
          with six heavy high slots.</p>
          <p>In the future we’ll also have unique slots – Used for very large weapons (i.e. spinal
          mount) that only fit on purpose-built ships.</p>
          <h4 id="new-house-sirius">New House: Sirius</h4>
          <p>The <a href="https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki/House-Sirius">Sirius House</a> has been
          implemented with custom graphics by enigmatic. It is not done yet, but you can fly around
          their systems and check out their ships. We hope to have missions and more content for
          them before the next release.</p>
          <h4 id="future-steps">Future Steps</h4>
          <p>The current plan is to try to actually balance the electronic warfare branch while
          creating all the weapons discussed on the <a href=
          "https://groups.google.com/d/topic/naev/NAofWIqhsQ4">Weapon Trees Rant</a>. The idea is
          to first implement as many of the weapons that do not need more advanced functionality
          and then balance them as discussed in the <a href=
          "https://groups.google.com/d/topic/naev/OtCAr_ArbEM">electronic warfare thread</a> so
          that the evasion, cloaking and detection parameters make sense.</p>
          <p>Afterwards it will be merged into bigsys branch and work will be done to better
          integrate the two. Basically, we’ll consider whether systems should become larger, and
          what sort of time compression scheme should be implemented for intra-system travel. Most
          likely at this time we’ll try to implement the Lua GUI scripting so that the user
          interface can be more advanced and players can even customize it themselves.</p>
          <p>Finally, bigsys will merge into master and the first beta will be released soon after.
          During this time we will concentrate on polish and content to try to make an epic 0.5.0
          release.</p>
          <p>And so concludes Volume 1 of the Sporadic NAEV Newsletter (SNN).</p>
