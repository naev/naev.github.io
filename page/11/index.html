          for Windows</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY DEIZ, ON FEBRUARY 20TH, 2015</p>
          <p>We’ve just released updated Windows installers to remedy save corruption and a related
          crash.</p>
          <p>Simply download and re-run the installer. It’s fine to run over top of the existing
          install, and you do not need to re-download ndata.</p>
          <p><a href=
          "https://sourceforge.net/projects/naev/files/naev-0.6.0/naev-0.6.0-beta1-win32.exe/download">
          Windows (32-bit)</a> <a href=

          Windows (64-bit)</a></p>
          <p>The issue affects all versions of Windows, as long as save compression is enabled
          (which is the default). You may also want to delete all backup saves, located in
          %APPDATA\naev\saves\ with the extension .ns.backup, though this isn’t required.</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2015-02-17_0.6.0-beta1/">0.6.0-beta1 Release</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY DEIZ, ON FEBRUARY 17TH, 2015</p>
          <p>Our last release was 0.5.3, way back in April 2012. Two years, ten months and some
          1400 commits later, we’ve finally prepared another release.</p>
          <p>We are proud to announce the 0.6.0-beta1 release today, and with any luck the final
          0.6.0 stable version will be released before March.</p>
          <p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=
          "https://sourceforge.net/projects/naev/files/naev-0.6.0/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/naev/files/naev-0.6.0/</a></p>
          <p><strong>Blog:</strong> <a href="https://naev.org/">https://naev.org/</a></p>
          <p><strong>Forums:</strong> http://forum.naev.org/ (Forums are lost.)</p>
          <p>A full changelog will accompany the stable release, but a few of the highlights
          include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="../../blarg/2012-08-19_slots_branch_merged/">Core slots system</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="../../blarg/2014-05-29_ndata_is_dead_long_live_ndata/">Naev’s data is now
              stored in a zip file, making contributing easier than ever</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Greatly expanded galaxy, including a new faction, Za’lek</li>
            <li>Activated outfits get hotkeys by default</li>
            <li>Fuel is now provided for free at spaceports</li>
            <li>Improved keyboard-and-mouse gameplay, with an optional WASD layout</li>
            <li>Auto-braking (Ctrl-S by default) in lieu of a dedicated Active Cooldown key</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Additionally there’s a slew of minor improvements, tweaks, new missions and the like
          for your enjoyment. As this is a beta release, we’re hoping to iron out any remaining
          issues, particularly with missions and other scripted content. If you run into any issues
          while playing, please report bugs and issues at our <a href=
          "https://github.com/naev/naev/issues">issue tracker</a> or drop by our IRC channel (RIP
          Freenode).</p>
          <p>Right now, we have builds available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, both 32-bit and
          64-bit.</p>
          <p>Lastly, one small note for those compiling from source: While Naev nominally supports
          SDL 2, several important things don’t function properly, like modifier keys and the mouse
          wheel, and error logging on Windows. We’re aiming to sort this out before 0.6.0 stable,
          but we advise players to stick with SDL 1.2 for the time being.</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2014-05-29_ndata_is_dead_long_live_ndata/">ndata is dead, long
          live ndata</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BTAXIS, ON MAY 29TH, 2014</p>
          <p>So here’s a recent development that may interest some of you out there. As you may
          know, Naev’s game data (sounds, images, script files, etc) comes packaged in an archive
          called ndata when you download a stable version. It’s a simple thing, little more than a
          concatenation of the files, but the trouble with it was that we were using our own
          format. This made it rather annoying to do anything with it other than just play the
          game.</p>
          <p>As of today, ndata’s format has changed, thanks to nloewen. It is now an uncompressed
          zip archive. This format is ubiquitous and supported by everything and its uncle, so it
          is now much easier to get at the data files themselves when downloading a stable release.
          The main upside to this is that people who are interested in how the game works, or in
          changing parts of the game can directly start tinkering without the need to re-download
          the data files from git.</p>
          <p>It’s a small change that doesn’t affect the game itself, but I’m happy to see the
          switch finally made.</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2014-05-20_helloooo/">Helloooo</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BTAXIS, ON MAY 20TH, 2014</p>
          <p>Hello everyone, here’s an update about the state of affairs surrounding Naev. I know,
          right? Yes, it’s been almost two years since our last post. You might think that that
          means little or nothing has been happening with the project, and mostly this is true, but
          not entirely.</p>
          <p>Let’s start with the thing that prompted this post in the first place. A great man
          once said:</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "“One does not simply get greenlit on Steam.”" src=
            "../../imgs/blarg/2014/05/boromir-One-does-not-simply-walk-into-Mordor.jpg"></div>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
              “One does not simply get greenlit on Steam.”
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>But, as we all know, Sean tends to be wrong about these things. As a matter of fact,
          <strong>Naev has been officially greenlit</strong>. This came as something as a surprise,
          since although people did occasionally comment and vote on the <a href=
          "https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=93971156&amp;tscn=1400016324">Greenlight
          page</a> it was by no means a hive of activity. But there you have it. Needless to say
          this is good news indeed.</p>
          <p>In other news, work has been going into the core slots system that currently only
          exists in the development version. The system is described in earlier posts, and Deiz has
          been improving the core outfit definitions. You can view <a href=
          "https://web.archive.org/web/20170730021511/http://wiki.naev.org/wiki/Core_slots_balancing_2">
          his notes</a> on the wiki. Once that is finished we’re hoping to get the game ready for a
          new release numbered 0.6.0. We may yet run into issues that have to be resolved first,
          but we’d really like to get a new release out the door in hopes of rekindling interest in
          the project. Fingers crossed!</p>
          <p>There has also been some discussion recently about the relationship between armour and
          shields within the game. There is some <a href=
          "https://web.archive.org/web/20170730021150/http://wiki.naev.org/wiki/Armour_Revamp">writing
          about that</a> on the wiki as well. It should be noted that this is not a proposal or
          anything we plan to do, at this point we haven’t decided on any course of action and the
          floor remains open for debate.</p>
          <p>Other than that a whole slew of minor corrections and content has also been constantly
          creeping in from a lot of different people. We hope this will make the experience
          smoother and more enjoyable for everyone.</p>
          <p>That’s it for now. Let’s hope there won’t be too much time until the next blog
          post.</p>

          the game accrues enough upvotes to be published on Steam is of secondary importance –
          every extra pair of eyes that sees our entry is good for us.</p>
