          <p>Okay, so, on those activated outfits, they’re now up and running in the Git version.
          For those of you who are curious about how it works, I’ll explain it briefly.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=

          <p>An activated outfit is a piece of equipment that does something when manually
          activated in space. While it’s off it does nothing, but it also doesn’t use any energy.
          On the other hand, once an activated outfit is turned on the benefit it gives is usually
          quite noticeable, and can make a big difference if used right.</p>
          <p>This means that the abilities activated outfits give you are highly situational and
          give you more things to worry about than just fly, point and shoot. In some ways, we are
          moving a little closer to the common skill bar you find in many action RPGs. Like those
          skills, our activated outfits can have a cooldown period too, which means you need to
          wait a certain time before you can use that same outfit again.</p>
          <p>At the moment, we only have two activated outfits, those being the Missile Jammer
          (which slows down missiles close to you) and the Afterburner. But we have plans for quite
          a few other outfits. For example, how about an outfit that instantaneously transports
          your ship to another part of the system, or an outfit that lets you quickly recharge your
          shield at the cost of a big chunk of energy? The possibilities are many.</p>
          <p>Activated outfits will be in the next release.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">BY BTAXIS, ON JANUARY 23RD, 2012</p>
          <p>Hello everyone, and a belated happy 2012. It’s been rather quiet here on the blog, but
          I assure you that’s only because nobody has been posting on it. Elsewhere we’re all still
          tinkering away on the project, and we’re hoping to build toward a new release in the near
          future. Before we can do that though, we need to put the finishing touches on the active
          outfit system. You see, we plan to add outfits you can install on your ship and activate
          once in space for all sorts of effects… Oh, but I can see you’re not very interested in
          that. So, let’s move on to something else that’s been happening:</p>
          <h4 id="asset-and-jump-discovery">Asset and jump discovery</h4>
          <p>Discovering assets (that’s planets and stations) and jump points used to be easy. Jump
          into a system, glance at the system map, voila, they’re all there. But that is changing.
          Just as ships become undetectable if they’re far away from you, so can assets and jump
          points be invisible to you, using much the same mechanics. For an easy example, look at
          the following screencaps:</p>
          <p><strong>NOTE</strong> These screenshots have been lost to time :(</p>
          <p>As you can see, it’s now possible for assets to not be shown on the map until the
          player discovers them. Now, I should point out that most planets tend to be fairly hard
          to miss in a star system, so when you jump into a new system you will usually discover
          all of them immediately, just like it’s always been. The example above isn’t
          representative in that respect – I simply modified the hide values for the purpose of
          showing how it works. However, if the system has high sensor interference (inside the
          nebula, for example), it may be more difficult to find the planets within.</p>
          <p>Space stations tend to be a fair bit smaller than celestial bodies however (yes yes,
          except THAT one). You may have to scout around a system a bit before they appear on the
          map, and if the station actually makes an effort of being inconspicuous (think hidden
          military or pirate bases), you won’t easily find them.</p>
          <p>Jump points, too, are more difficult to detect than your average planet. You usually
          won’t spot any jump points other than the one you entered from when jumping in, which
          means you can’t plot a course to the next unknown system before first finding the way
          there. So how will you know where the jump points are then? Well, you could fly around
          and look for them yourself, but there are a number of things you can do to find them more
          reliably:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Follow other pilots. Especially traders often travel to other systems, and they
            know all the major routes. If you see a trader fly away from a planet, try following
            it. Chances are it will lead you to a jump point.</li>
            <li>Talk to NPCs in the spaceport bars. Not only do NPCs offer you missions sometimes,
            they will also give you helpful information. Some may even offer to update your map
            with locations of assets or jump points if you don’t know them already.</li>
            <li>Buy maps. As of the next version of Naev, the Star Map outfit has been replaced by
            a collection of pre-defined maps. Each map reveals one or more star systems, and may or
            may not reveal jumps and assets belonging to them. Buying a map for the Empire Core,
            for example, will immediately update your map with systems in Empire space, as well as
            the jumps leading from one to the other.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There are also rumors of new, exotic types of jump points, such as hidden jump points
          that can’t be detected without special equipment, known only to a selected few. There
          also seems to be a kind of jump point that can’t be detected at all, and that only be
          used from the other side…</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2011-10-16_disabling_revamp/">Disabling Revamp</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON OCTOBER 16TH, 2011</p>
          <p>So, this was done a while back; finally getting around to posting about it. Briefly,
          we’ve changed how disabling works: Instead of auto-disabling when a ship reaches 30% base
          armour, you can now take disabling damage. As for how this works, weapons can now deal
          two types of damage: normal and disabling. Disabling damage is only applied when your
          armour is hit, and this increases your disable damage. If the amount of disabling damage
          taken exceeds your current armour, your ship is disabled. This applies to all ships and
          will make it so now you have to outfit to safely disable ships. However, specialized new
          missiles come to the rescue and provide disabling damage so that you don’t have to
          sacrifice shield piercing abilities for your cannons/turrets.</p>
          <p>As a side note, this now means the player’s ship can be disabled. If your ship is
          disabled, you can be boarded, so prepare to see pirates boarding your poor, sad ship and
          looting your hard-earned funds. As a side mechanic, disabled ships do automatically
          recover after a while, so this means clumps of disabled ships won’t accumulate around
          dangerous jump points. There are limits to what they can steal, so don’t worry about
          losing all your credits to a lone pirate. We believe that this will make the game more
          interesting, especially as we introduce more complex mechanics that will interact with
          this.</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2011-07-24_recent_developments/">Recent developments</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BTAXIS, ON JULY 24TH, 2011</p>
          <p>It has been some time since you’ve heard from us, so I’m taking it upon myself to give
          you all an idea of what’s going on with Naev.</p>
          <p>The first thing I should mention is that is is summer for Naev, and summer usually
          means a lull in activity. It has to do with lots of other things happening in summer,
          many of them outdoor ones. I think you get the idea.</p>
          <p>That said, things have been happening since the 0.5.0 release. The original plan for
          the next version, 0.5.1, was, and I <a href=
          "https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/naev?date=2011-06-16#l296">quote</a>:</p>
          <p>14:16 bobbens we can do safe lanes</p>
          <p>14:16 bobbens for starters</p>
          <p>14:16 bobbens although I’m not sure on the safe lane stuff how to procede</p>
          <p>14:16 bobbens we can either go safe lane “simple implementation” first</p>
          <p>14:16 bobbens for quick release</p>
          <p>14:16 bobbens or go quadtrees and asteroids first</p>
          <p>14:16 bobbens for a slower crazy release</p>
          <p>Once this discussion was over, we promptly started working on completely different
          things. One of those things is the revised faction standing mechanic, described in a
          <a href="../../blarg/2011-06-20_expanding_on_faction_standing_and_landing/">previous
          blarg post</a>. But there is more.</p>
          <h4 id="disabling">Disabling</h4>
          <p>For instance, work is ongoing on a revised disabling system. Up until 0.5.0, ships
          would become disabled once they sustained enough damage (to be precise, once armour fell
          below 20%), and that was the end of it. However, one of our team members (it was me) felt
          that this was undesirable, and designed something different. Rather than always being
          disabled through damage directly, ships now accrue “stress” damage, which builds up as
          weapons do damage, and falls naturally over time. Once stress damage equals the amount of
          armour the ship still has left, the ship becomes disabled. Assuming the ship is not
          destroyed afterward, it will come back online after a certain amount of time.</p>
          <p>The important part in the above is that stress damage needs to reach the amount of
          armour health left on the ship. The direct implication of this is that ships with low
          health are more easily disabled than ships with high health, without tying the concepts
          of “low” and “high” to the ship’s maximum amount of health. This means that a small ship
          can be reliably disabled without running the risk of destroying it, for example.</p>
          <p>The introduction of stress damage in itself also gives us the opportunity to
          differentiate weapons further. In practice, this means that most weapons will do minimal
          amounts of disable damage, much less than their actual physical damage, so that it’s
          almost impossible to disable a ship before killing it. On the other hand, certain other
          weapons will deal a lot of stress damage and limited amounts of physical damage, so that
          stress damage easily builds up toward the critical level.</p>
          <h4 id="missiles">Missiles</h4>
          <p>One of our current efforts is to make missiles more meaningful while at the same time
          not placing too much emphasis on them. In 0.5.0, most missiles are mostly useless, for
          various reasons. For instance, damage was low and the likelihood of missiles hitting fast
          targets or targets with jammers was rather low. One of our team members (it was me again)
          came up with an alternative missile system that would allow missiles to be more useful
          while hopefully not be too dominating.</p>
          <p>In the new system, a missile weapon must acquire a lock on the target before it can
          fire. To acquire this lock, the target must be kept within the missile lockon area, which
          is an arc in front of the ship for normal launchers and everywhere for turreted
          launchers. The time the launcher takes to lock on depends on the lockon time defined for
          that launcher, and on the level of stealth of the target. As a general rule, small
          targets are more stealthy than bigger ones. So while an interceptor missile might lock on
          to a capital ship very quickly, a heavy torpedo would take a very long time to lock on to
          a fighter. Stealth is further affected by electronic warfare outfits such as passive
          scramblers and, to be implemented, jammers that must be activated and provide a
          short-term boost.</p>
          <p>Once fired, missiles are quite good at finding their targets. Unlike most of the old
          missiles, all missiles now predict where their target is going to be, so unless the
          target can actually outmaneuver the missile, the missile will usually hit. The new
          missiles also do considerably more damage, so being hit by one can be quite painful. The
          aim is that most missiles are optimally suited to a certain class of ship, however,
          dealing too little damage to seriously hurt targets bigger than that and being too slow
          and sluggish to catch faster ones.</p>
          <h4 id="ship-health">Ship health</h4>
          <p>A somewhat minor change, but perhaps worth mentioning here is the overhaul of ship
          health. Where ship armour and shields more or less linearly increased as the ships got
          bigger and heavier, one of our team members (it was me, sorry) felt a different
          philosophy should be followed.</p>
          <p>Small ships now rely mainly on their maneuverability and their shields, as before.
          Their hulls are made out of bread, relatively speaking, so only a few hits will be enough
          to destroy them. Avoiding fire in an engagement is key to survival.</p>
          <p>Big ships have received substantial cuts to their shielding. While they still have
          more shielding in absolute terms than smaller ships, the increase becomes less and less
          as ships get bigger. On the other hand, armour has been drastically increased. The idea
          here is that big ships, as big and lumbering as they are, will run out of shields in most
          serious encounters, but survive on armour for a considerable time after that. When combat
          is over shields will come back up but armour will not. In this manner, capital ships will
          get worn down between engagements, and will eventually have to return to a friendly
          planet or station to make repairs. Of course, this assumes combat will be sporadic and
          intense, as opposed to constant and niggling (as is currently the case!). All in good
          time.</p>
          <p>I should also mention that shield regeneration has been boosted across the board,
          hopefully enough to make the regeneration actually matter in the middle of combat. I’m
          sure we’ll be tweaking that more in the future.</p>
          <h4 id="soromid">Soromid</h4>
          <p>Following contributions of some great ship models by <a href=
          "https://web.archive.org/web/20160820095618/http://forum.naev.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=174">
          Viruk</a>, a new faction has been added to the Naev galaxy. The Soromid already existed
          as a <a href="https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki/The-Soromid">lore writeup</a> previously,
          but now they also own ships, stations and planets. In the future, they will also receive
          their own weapon specialization, and of course their own missions.</p>
          <p>You can see a map of their territory to the right. It is located in the north of the
          galaxy, where previously there were only empty systems. Not anymore!</p>
          <h4 id="also">Also</h4>
          <p>Our team leader bobbens is working on a personal project as well. You can see the
          result here.</p>
          <p><strong>NOTE</strong> Unfortunately the above mentioned screenshot is lost, and there
          is some mention of bobbens’ toe. I wish I could tell you what that was all about -
