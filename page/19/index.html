          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON JANUARY 21ST, 2011</p>
          <p>As part of our move to become more independent from Google’s services, which should
          allow us more flexibility and comfort, we have decided to host <a href=
          "https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki">our own</a> wiki. This wiki will allow us to organize
          proposals, todo and overall design considerations by centralizing them. This does not
          make either the forums or the mailing list obsolete, but complements them. It’s not fully
          fleshed out yet, but it is already far superior to the old one. If you are interested in
          Naev and would like to contribute to <a href="https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki">the
          wiki</a>, feel free.</p>
          <p>One decision we have taken on <a href="https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki">the wiki</a>
          is that we do not want every planet to have it’s own article. The wiki should focus on
          general information for both developers and players, without recording individual
          details. So, while the <a href="https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki/The-Empire">Empire
          faction</a> gets it’s own page, the planet Em 5 does not. As with all wikis, we ask that
          you please do not add stuff you would like to see in game directly without getting the
          approval of a devteam member. However, you are completely free to write a proposal and
          submit that for review. You are all welcome to use <a href=
          "https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki">the Naev wiki</a>, let the editing begin!</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2011-01-14_naev_etymology/">Naev Etymology</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON JANUARY 14TH, 2011</p>
          <p>Today we’ll talk about the name of this game: it’s history, pronunciation and how to
          write it. First off a bit of history, as you probably do know, NAEV originally stood for
          “<em>Neutron Accelerated Extreme Velocity</em>” although “<em>Not Another Escape
          Velocity</em>” was also widely accepted. The original idea was to sort of create an
          improved clone of the <a href=
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_%28video_game%29">original Escape Velocity
          game</a>. However with the 0.5.0 release we will transcend that. Naev is no longer a
          clone and therefore no longer an acronym, it is now a proper noun. So from now on no more
          NAEV, only Naev! You may notice I have been changing that, this unification of criteria
          will make it easier to handle and no longer cause confusion.</p>
          <p>Now onto pronunciation, how is it pronounced? In case someday we hold a Naev meet or
          the likes we should all know how to pronounce it so we don’t make a mess and fools of
          ourselves (we probably will anyway). The proper way to pronounce Naev is
          <strong>/nɑ.ɛv/</strong> if I got right my symbols (would need confirmation). I know most
          of you pronounce it more like knave, but trust me, that is wrong.</p>
          <p>For those who still have doubts on how to pronounce: Naev Pronunciation</p>
          <p><strong>Naev /nɑ.ɛv/</strong> An open source action/RPG space video game.</p>
          <p><strong>NOTE</strong> Unfortunately it looks like we will have to rely on phonetic
          spelling due to a missing sound clip.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON JANUARY 8TH, 2011</p>
          <p>Recently the new x.org brought me frustration. My open source driver broke down and I
          was left without being able to run Naev. After realizing I needed a kernel upgrade I
          found out the biggest benefit of gallium3d: I can make videos! So kudos to the open
          source ati driver team. Here’s a video showing off preliminary 0.5.0 alpha gameplay in
          the balance branch.</p>
          <p>Things to note:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I’m using forward cannons, swivel for the win!</li>
            <li>Using HatlessAtlas’ new AI, it’s harder to follow and track them</li>
            <li>Pretty backgrounds (for those who haven’t seen 0.5.0 in action)</li>
            <li>Smooth camera and dynamic zoom (zoom will be revised a bit more probably)</li>
            <li>New rumble (it’s preliminary, but much smoother)</li>
            <li>Penetration model (I barely get hurt – maybe more balancing needed)</li>
            <li>New weapons</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This is not meant to be a really serious video, just me fooling off and showing my
          awesome ship build and mad skills.</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2010-12-31_pew_pew_pew/">0.5.0 Status Update</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON DECEMBER 31ST, 2010</p>
          <p>Lots of you have complained about accuracy in Naev and hitting stuff with forward
          mounts. As part of the increased range and weapon rants it was unbearable in the sense
          you never hit anything unless you went point blank. I am proud to announce the
          implementation of swivel forward mounts. That means all weapons have a tendency to
          correct minor errors in accuracy. The longer the range generally the more they
          compensate. This also works similar to turrets with electronic warfare, but generally the
          accuracy is much higher with forward mounts than with turrets. Hopefully this will make
          forward mounted weapons actually usable.</p>
          <p>You can check out the changes in the every unstable balance branch on github.</p>
          <p><strong>NOTE</strong> This screenshot has been lost to time :(</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2010-12-21_0.5.0_status_update/">0.5.0 Status Update</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON DECEMBER 21ST, 2010</p>
          <p>We haven’t posted in a while, so I decided to update even though we don’t have
          anything spectacular done (depending on your definition of spectacular). So what is going
          on? As you may know the current development and broken branch is the balance branch (This
          branch is now long dead, unsure of the commit sha). This branch is active and
          <strong>will mangle your saves</strong> if you load it. Why? It’s caused by the
          implementation of <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/naev/NAofWIqhsQ4">the weapon
          rant</a>, which makes it so all the weapon are changed. Some retain their name, but most
          get lost in the transition. This is unavoidable and will happen to everyone once it’s
          merged back, but it shouldn’t happen again then.</p>
          <p>Other things, ewarfare has more or less been balanced. We’ve introduced another
          parameter for heat. So the more your ship heats up, the more visible it is. The equations
          are also tweaked in such a way they make more sense and are cooler overall. Also turrets
          finally use it, so you can’t track a fighter with a long range anti-capship turret. This
          all may still need fine tuning but it is working quite well.</p>
          <p>Another major change which has broken a lot of missions is the fact we’ve changed the
          time model. Previously time only changed when you landed or jumped. Now time will change
          while flying too. That means that slower ships will waste more time in system while jump
          times will be very similar. This sort of makes everything more interesting and realistic
          which is quite cool. However it means we have to revamp all our cargo missions which we
          want to rethink anyway when we do economics. For now we’ll probably keep them similar to
          how they’ve always been, but in the future we’ll change it.</p>
          <p>Finally mentioning some changes we want to do. With google being more and more evil,
          we’ve been thinking of completely foregoing both google code and google groups. We’re
          working on having our own wiki which shouldn’t take too long to be available. If someone
          is really interested in helping out we can sort of speed it up and spread the
          half-finishedness. It still needs lots of love. Secondly we’re considering the
          possibility of also hosting our own mailing list, but we’ll see about that. That hasn’t
          even been started.</p>
          <p>Closing words on the release. The original intention was to release end of 2010,
          however we believe it is much more important to have a good solid release than a
          half-finished rushed release that will need a dozen bugfixes to be playable. We would
          like to still release at the end of 2010, but chances are we’ll just do a beta at the
          start of 2011. There’s still much to do, need to finish some stuff and then fix
          everything we broke. To speed up the release we are trying to delay changes that aren’t
          fundamental, however we also want this release to sort of establish the maturity of Naev,
          but chances are 0.6.0 will be the true maturity once we get there.</p>
          <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> We’ll release when it’s ready :)</p>
