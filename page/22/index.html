          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2010-08-23_next_steps_to_0.5.0/">Next steps to 0.5.0</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON AUGUST 23RD, 2010</p>
          <p>I’ve been asked multiple times what the ETA for 0.5.0 is. For now, the answer is “when
          it’s done”, but going over the TODO, it seems like it’ll be around New Years. Many of our
          original goals are done, but the list seems to grow faster than features are finished;
          here’s what’s left:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Weapon Revamp</strong> – Removes secondary weapons in favour of dynamic
            player-defined weapon groups (WIP).</li>
            <li><strong>Tech Editor</strong> – Incorporate a technology editor to allow balancing
            technology and the likes much faster.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish GUI</strong> – With the weapon revamp we should be finally able to
            get a new awesome epic GUI done. This builds upon the Lua infrastructure we now have
            for GUI development.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish Electronic Warfare</strong> – One of the major 0.5.0 objectives.
            It’s more or less implemented, but needs to actually have the outfits and ships use it.
            The major issue is balancing, which is complex to say the least. This is when we merge
            ewarfare into bigsys.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Time Compression</strong> – Sick of flying around slow in your big
            capital ship? Dynamic time compression will make travel fast and fluid when out of
            combat. When you enter combat you’ll revert to your ship’s normal handling
            characteristics. This is mainly to allow large slow ships to be less tedious to fly,
            especially in big systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Overlay Map</strong> – We want a Diablo 2-style map overlay in the big
            systems, the current infrastructure isn’t cutting it. With big systems there’s so many
            things in each system it’s hard to keep track of things in the minimap. An overlay will
            allow you to see whole systems, more or less, without sacrificing the minimap’s
            usefulness in combat. You’ll be able to toggle it on command.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish Big Systems</strong> – With the overlay and electronic warfare done
            we want to finally complete big systems. This means systems will be even larger and
            you’ll have intra-system travel and combat. Time compression will make it all painless
            and the overlay will make it so you don’t get lost. This is when everything gets merged
            into master.</li>
            <li><strong>Beam Rewrite</strong> – Beam weapons are due for a makeover. They’re
            currently an awful hack. They shall be moved into their own infrastructure and be
            upgraded to comply with OpenGL ES specification. The AI will also start using them
            efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Mouse Usage</strong> – Target cycling is cute, but when each system has 30+
            ships in visible range, selecting a specific ship is tedious. This will allow mouse
            targeting and limited mouse flying (have the ship face the mouse, etc.) among other
            things.</li>
            <li><strong>Heavy Testing</strong> – This is a <em>huge</em> release, so a beta will
            likely be released. NAEV is typically quite stable and bug-free, but we’d like to avoid
            pure-maintenance releases in 0.5.*. We’ve had our share of embarrassing bugs during
            past releases and we don’t want that to happen again.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>As you can see there’s a lot of stuff left. That’s a lot of work not to mention all
          the new content we’re getting done in parallel. You might think that 0.5.0 is the end of
          the line but we have many many more ideas which will most likely be for 0.6.0. So as you
          can see we aren’t being lazy nor inefficient, we’re just overly-ambitious. The end goal
          is to have 0.5.0 be a mature and stable platform for which all you modders and content
          developers will be able to mess with. Anyway, bear with us, this release is going to be
          epic. Most of you who only played up to 0.4.2 will have to relearn the entire game as
          it’s much more advanced. However don’t fear the change, it’s for the better and has been
          all heavily discussed and analyzed before being implemented. If you still worry, feel
          free to grab a copy of the ‘ewarfare’ branch on git and drop us some a line on IRC, the
          forum or the mailing list.</p>
          <p>Some stats to give you an indication of the magnitude of the change:</p>
          <p><code>bobbens@ghanima (~/usr/prj/naev)] $ git diff NAEV-0.4.2 | wc -l 78621</code></p>
          <p>Yes, that’s nearly 80k line changes in the diff from the latest version and that’s
          with the gigantic TODO we have left. Scary, huh?</p>
          <p>Bobbens out.</p>

          effects: Improving screenshots since 2010.</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY DEIZ, ON AUGUST 16TH, 2010</p>
          <p>Space is an immense, largely vacuous void. The ratio of nothingness to interesting
          phenomena is pitifully high. Among even those rare phenomena, the amount perceptible by
          the human eye pales in comparison to wider-wavelength recording combined with false
          colours.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, however, NAEV is a game, not a simulator. It’s a bit boring to fly over
          endless blackness with nothing but stars to keep you company. Ships and large planets,
          while pretty, come and go with alarming rapidity.</p>
          <p>To that end, we’ve endeavoured to make NAEV more visually enticing by implementing
          support for background graphics. In all, there are more than 30 backgrounds, with more to
          come, hopefully. I suppose it’s time to let the pictures do the talking (Note: They’re
          much larger in-game):</p>
          <p><strong>NOTE</strong> The screenshots have been lost to time :(</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2010-08-12_save_the_events/">Save the Events!</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON AUGUST 12TH, 2010</p>
          <p>After a post in the forum reminded me that it’s stupid that events can’t save
          themselves. I have decided to correct that. So finally after ages of having events sort
          of naturally die we have persistent events. Events work different from missions and in
          this aspect too. For an event to be saved you must explicitly tell it to be saved with
          <a href="https://naev.org/api/modules/evt.html#save">evt.save()</a>. This will make it
          save itself. Also added sanity checks, but there is always the danger (unlike with
          missions) that an event goes crazy and can’t complete. The player since he has no control
          over this won’t be able to eliminate it and over time we may have an issue with event
          bloat in save games. Hopefully this won’t happen since I’ve added checks for the common
          cause of events becoming inert, which is not having any hooks.</p>
          <p>Either way I hope having events can lead to a more dynamic universe in the sense that
          some small scripted actions can appear randomly. Something like scientists screaming in
          falling elevators but in outer space. So keep your eyes open for scripted coolness in
          development version (or 0.5.0 when it’s released).</p>

          <p>The packages (<a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/?q=naev">naev and naev-data</a>)
          are still quite new, so some mirrors may not have synced yet.</p>
          <p>Special thanks to cleanrock, who created and maintained the Arch User Repository
          PKGBUILD, and to those who voted for NAEV’s inclusion in the official repositories,
          without which we’d likely not be packaged.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">BY DEIZ, ON JULY 24TH, 2010</p>
          <p>To complement this blog, we’ve now added <a href=
          "https://github.com/naev/naev/discussions">a forum</a> to the site.</p>
          <p>It’s somewhat bare at the moment, but it should provide a good venue for feedback, and
          it’s certainly a more familiar format for many users who aren’t used to mailing lists and
          IRC channels.</p>
          <p>The observant NAEV players among you may have noticed that the blog and forum logos
          differ from what’s in-game (as of 0.4.2). That’s thanks to Scaatis, and there’s a forum
          thread on the art he’s contributed here: (<strong>NOTE</strong> This linked to the lost
          forums). Typographical geeks may notice that the new logo is in fact an <a href=
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram">ambigram</a>.</p>
          <p>In time we’ll also roll out a proper (non-Google Code) Wiki here on naev.org and
          integrate it with the forum.</p>
