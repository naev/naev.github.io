          Dizzyness</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON MARCH 7TH, 2011</p>
          <p>It has come to my attention that numerous people become dizzy while playing Naev. As
          it is to my interest that no physical discomfort happen while playing Naev I’ve dealt
          with probably the first cause which is the zoom. While the zoom is nice to have automatic
          (and you can tweak it’s behaviour), it seems like it can make people dizzy. So Naev now
          has an option to enable manual zoom. It is controlled by mouse wheel, however I’ll
          probably add key bindings in the near future.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "Location of the checkbox to enable manual zoom." src=

              Location of the checkbox to enable manual zoom.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>This is a start. If anybody experiences dizziness still with Naev 0.5.0 I’d be very
          interested in feedback and investigation into what exactly triggers it to try to solve
          the issue.</p>

          <p>As part of our move to become more independent from Google’s services, which should
          allow us more flexibility and comfort, we have decided to host <a href=
          "https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki">our own</a> wiki. This wiki will allow us to organize
          proposals, todo and overall design considerations by centralizing them. This does not
          make either the forums or the mailing list obsolete, but complements them. It’s not fully
          fleshed out yet, but it is already far superior to the old one. If you are interested in
          Naev and would like to contribute to <a href="https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki">the
          wiki</a>, feel free.</p>
          <p>One decision we have taken on <a href="https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki">the wiki</a>
          is that we do not want every planet to have it’s own article. The wiki should focus on
          general information for both developers and players, without recording individual
          details. So, while the <a href="https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki/The-Empire">Empire
          faction</a> gets it’s own page, the planet Em 5 does not. As with all wikis, we ask that
          you please do not add stuff you would like to see in game directly without getting the
          approval of a devteam member. However, you are completely free to write a proposal and
          submit that for review. You are all welcome to use <a href=
          "https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki">the Naev wiki</a>, let the editing begin!</p>

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2011-01-14_naev_etymology/">Naev Etymology</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON JANUARY 14TH, 2011</p>
          <p>Today we’ll talk about the name of this game: it’s history, pronunciation and how to
          write it. First off a bit of history, as you probably do know, NAEV originally stood for
          “<em>Neutron Accelerated Extreme Velocity</em>” although “<em>Not Another Escape
          Velocity</em>” was also widely accepted. The original idea was to sort of create an
          improved clone of the <a href=
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_%28video_game%29">original Escape Velocity
          game</a>. However with the 0.5.0 release we will transcend that. Naev is no longer a
          clone and therefore no longer an acronym, it is now a proper noun. So from now on no more
          NAEV, only Naev! You may notice I have been changing that, this unification of criteria
          will make it easier to handle and no longer cause confusion.</p>
          <p>Now onto pronunciation, how is it pronounced? In case someday we hold a Naev meet or
          the likes we should all know how to pronounce it so we don’t make a mess and fools of
          ourselves (we probably will anyway). The proper way to pronounce Naev is
          <strong>/nɑ.ɛv/</strong> if I got right my symbols (would need confirmation). I know most
          of you pronounce it more like knave, but trust me, that is wrong.</p>
          <p>For those who still have doubts on how to pronounce: Naev Pronunciation</p>
          <p><strong>Naev /nɑ.ɛv/</strong> An open source action/RPG space video game.</p>
          <p><strong>NOTE</strong> Unfortunately it looks like we will have to rely on phonetic
          spelling due to a missing sound clip.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON JANUARY 8TH, 2011</p>
          <p>Recently the new x.org brought me frustration. My open source driver broke down and I
          was left without being able to run Naev. After realizing I needed a kernel upgrade I
          found out the biggest benefit of gallium3d: I can make videos! So kudos to the open
          source ati driver team. Here’s a video showing off preliminary 0.5.0 alpha gameplay in
          the balance branch.</p>
          <p>Things to note:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I’m using forward cannons, swivel for the win!</li>
            <li>Using HatlessAtlas’ new AI, it’s harder to follow and track them</li>
            <li>Pretty backgrounds (for those who haven’t seen 0.5.0 in action)</li>
            <li>Smooth camera and dynamic zoom (zoom will be revised a bit more probably)</li>
            <li>New rumble (it’s preliminary, but much smoother)</li>
            <li>Penetration model (I barely get hurt – maybe more balancing needed)</li>
            <li>New weapons</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This is not meant to be a really serious video, just me fooling off and showing my
          awesome ship build and mad skills.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON DECEMBER 31ST, 2010</p>
          <p>Lots of you have complained about accuracy in Naev and hitting stuff with forward
          mounts. As part of the increased range and weapon rants it was unbearable in the sense
          you never hit anything unless you went point blank. I am proud to announce the
          implementation of swivel forward mounts. That means all weapons have a tendency to
          correct minor errors in accuracy. The longer the range generally the more they
          compensate. This also works similar to turrets with electronic warfare, but generally the
          accuracy is much higher with forward mounts than with turrets. Hopefully this will make
          forward mounted weapons actually usable.</p>
          <p>You can check out the changes in the every unstable balance branch on github.</p>
