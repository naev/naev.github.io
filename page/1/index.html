          <p>With big releases, come big bugs. A bug that would potentially mark the entire
          player’s map as known has crept into the release. It has been fixed along with other
          minor fixes, in particular, a bug made the obelisk tests require manual setting of weapon
          sets, and a persistent ship AI repeating to the player over and over that they haven’t
          played in a while.</p>
          <p>You can get the latest version from any of the following sources:</p>

          <p class="text-muted">BY NAEV DEVTEAM, ON DECEMBER 23RD, 2024</p>
          <p>After a whole month of beta testing and furious bug fixing, following the tradition,
          we are once again doing our yearly release. This release includes many engine
          improvements, such as 3D ships, an in-game wiki, reworked weapon sets, notable
          performance increases, etc., but also a significant amount of new content including a
          whole new area, more and reworked missions, and ship variants among others things. We
          also have not forgotten significant quality of life improvements; folding messages, more
          visual indications for things such as important characters at the spaceport bar,
          filtering for the mission computer, and more!</p>
          <p>We would like to thank all the contributors who participated and helped in the making
          of this release that we hope will both surprise new players and veterans alike!</p>
          <p>Most notable changes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Nearly all the ships are now modeled in 3D with fancy lighting and tilting
            effects!</li>
            <li>You can now capture ships!</li>
            <li>New ships and ship variants!</li>
            <li>Faction reputation is no longer a single global value, but more nuanced and
            local.</li>
            <li>Simplified and more powerful weapon sets</li>
            <li>New challenging area to access many secrets.</li>
            <li>In-game Wiki full of mechanics and lore explanations!</li>
          </ul>

          <p>A lot of major and minor issues, in addition to some minor new features, have been
          resolved calling for a 0.12.0-beta.2. In particular, support for lowering the saturation
          of the nebula, and having escorts respect your autonav preferences (you can disable it in
          the settings from the info menu) have been added as new features. We don’t have any
          intention of adding any new features before the final 0.12.0 version, and will keep on
          resolving bugs as they are found. As always, please report any issues on <a href=

          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2024-11-16_0.12.0-beta.1/">Naev 0.12.0-beta.1</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON NOVEMBER 16TH, 2024</p>
          <p>This year, we’re starting the betas a bit early given the large amount of content
          modified and added. As always, this release contains a large amount of changes done
          during the past year which likely have introduced a lot of bugs and issues that we want
          to iron out before the final release of 0.12.0.</p>
          <p>Now, this release changes a lot of how the game currently plays, and, while it is
          highly recommended to start a new game, it should be possible to just load up your old
          saves without too much stuff being changed. In particular, some of the major changes
          are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Nearly all the ships are now modeled in 3D with fancy lighting and tilting
            effects!</li>
            <li>You can now capture ships!</li>
            <li>New ships and ship variants!</li>
            <li>Faction reputation is no longer a single global value, but more nuanced and
            local.</li>
            <li>New challenging area to access many secrets.</li>
            <li>In-game Wiki full of mechanics and lore explanations!</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If you try it and find any issues, please report them at <a href=
          "https://github.com/naev/naev/issues">the issue tracker</a>. Discussion about the game
          can be had on one of the various discussion forums and chatrooms we have. Check them out
          <a href="https://naev.org/contact/">here!</a></p>
