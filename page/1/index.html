          <h4><a href="../../blarg/2024-11-16_0.12.0-beta.1/">Naev 0.12.0-beta.1</a></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON NOVEMBER 16TH, 2024</p>
          <p>This year, we’re starting the betas a bit early given the large amount of content
          modified and added. As always, this release contains a large amount of changes done
          during the past year which likely have introduced a lot of bugs and issues that we want
          to iron out before the final release of 0.12.0.</p>
          <p>Now, this release changes a lot of how the game currently plays, and, while it is
          highly recommended to start a new game, it should be possible to just load up your old
          saves without too much stuff being changed. In particular, some of the major changes
          are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Nearly all the ships are now modelled in 3D with fancy lightings and tilting
            effects!</li>
            <li>You can now capture ships!</li>
            <li>New ships and ship variants!</li>
            <li>Faction reputation is no longer a single global value, but more nuanced and
            local.</li>
            <li>New challenging area to access many secrets.</li>
            <li>In-game Wiki full of mechanics and lore explanations!</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If you try it and find any issues, please report them at <a href=
          "https://github.com/naev/naev/issues">the issue tracker</a>. Discussion about the game
          can be had on one of the various discussion forums and chatrooms we have. Check them out
          <a href="https://naev.org/contact/">here!</a></p>

          <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON JULY 21ST, 2024</p>
          <p>This year we’re having another edition of our Sporadic Naev Newsletter. We’ll be
          covering <a href="https://github.com/naev/naev/blob/main/CHANGELOG">some of the
          improvements</a> that will appear in the 0.12.0 release, and more importantly, discuss a
          feature almost 15 years in the making: Naev going 3D! Now, this doesn’t mean gameplay is
          going 3D - gameplay is fundamentally unchanged - however, the ship models are now in 3D,
          allowing us to do new fancy effects and lower memory consumption while at it!</p>

          <h4 id="less-pirates-in-the-early-game">Less Pirates in the Early Game</h4>
          <p>One of the major complaints that Naev always gets is how ruthless pirates are,
          especially in the early game, when the player has no proper defenses. Although the past
          several releases have tried to mitigate the issue by establishing a safe starting area
          with no pirates, and adding more introductory missions to help the player get started,
          for those players that strayed too far from the starting area, it was often fatal. Now,
          Chapter 0 will feature significantly less pirates, that will ramp up to normal when the
          player reaches Chapter 1. This should give the player time to get better ships and
          survive the pirate menace.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">

              Universe diff support in the universe editor.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>In order to implement this feature, the in-game universe editor was significantly
          reworked (yet again!) to support universe diffs, that is, instead of saving the entire
          universe, only changes with the default are saved. While this has been used only for
          reducing pirates, for now, this is going to come very in hand when implementing the next
          stages of the major campaigns, where the universe will undergo many significant changes.
          It will definitely be a good investment for things to come.</p>
          <h4 id="naev-now-in-3d">Naev, now in 3D!</h4>
          <p>So, while this is something that was proposed around 15 years ago, this is something
          that has been quite active in the works for almost 5 years now. During that time, it has
          been rewritten twice: first using object files and more traditional rendering, and now
          using gltf files with physically-based rendering. As we’re not using any sort of game
          engine, it was all written from the ground up, and includes some fancy things like
          variance shadow maps, FidelityFX filtering, high dynamic tone mapping, and super
          sampling. There’s still many things to do, but this finally lets us start to do fancier
          things that were infeasible using spritesheets. That said, spritesheets are still
          supported, however, 3D models are the recommended way of adding new ships.</p>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>It has taken a lot of work, but all the ancient models have been updated to work with
          the newest blender, and many models have seen upgrades in different aspects like
          texturing, engine glows, broken geometry, and animations. Some ships have had to be
          nearly completely remade to work with current standards. There’s still a lot to do, but
          they look much better, and the same model can be used in the shipyard, communication
          window, and in-game.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>With 3D, we finally can also have ships tilt slightly when turning. This makes flying
          feel much more natural, and the tilt shows off more highlights and details of the ships.
          While we were hoping to add blinking lights and more details, those have not yet been
          implemented, but there is a real possibility that they will come sooner and later, once
          some logistics are figured out.</p>

          <p>For now, only ships have been reworked into 3D, but we hope to have planets, stations,
          and asteroids to join them in the near future. Some effects such as the backgrounds,
          wormholes, and the likes will still be kept in 2D, however, it will all work much better
          together. Oh, and last but not least, we’ve taken this opportunity to add 4 new ships to
          flesh out a bit more the Naev universe!</p>
          <h4 id="linear-energy-regeneration">Linear Energy Regeneration</h4>
          <p>Although many players had not noticed, energy regeneration in Naev used an RC
          (Resistance-Capacitor) charge curve, which meant that energy would regenerate faster the
          less you had, and slowly taper out. This was not properly conveyed to the player and has
          now made linear. Now 100 GW of energy regeneration will always be 100 GJ of energy
          generated per second. While it is not possible to keep exactly the same behaviour as
          before, outfits and ships have been adjusted to try to be as similar as before the
          change.</p>
          <h4 id="quality-of-life-for-all">Quality of Life for all!</h4>
          <p>A lot of Quality of Life has also made it into the nightly. Spaceport bar is marked
          with red exclamation points when there is an interesting NPC, there is support for
          sorting and filtering mission computer missions, repeated messages get folded in the GUI,
          asteroids won’t disappear when the player is nearby or actively targeting them, and much
          more! This should ensure a smoother experience for the players and get rid of lots of
          small friction.</p>
          <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
            <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
            "You can now sort missions and it is easier to tell when new missions are available at the spaceport bar."

              the spaceport bar.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Additionally, the game uses lazy loading and threading to load much faster than
          before, starting up much faster and using less memory in general.</p>
          <h4 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding Remarks</h4>
          <p>All the aforementioned fixes can be already tasted in the nightly branch which can be
          obtained through the steam beta, <a href=
          "https://github.com/naev/naev/releases/tag/nightly">github</a>, or <a href=
          "https://naev.itch.io/naev">itch.io</a>. They will be included in the next 0.12.0 release
          which is scheduled for December if you’d rather wait for a more stable release instead of
          risking the bleeding edge. If you’re interested in seeing the full changelog, including
          things that have not been discussed here, it’s <a href=
