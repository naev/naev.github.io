    <h2>Helloooo</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">BY BTAXIS, ON MAY 20TH, 2014</p>
    <p>Hello everyone, here’s an update about the state of affairs surrounding Naev. I know, right?
    Yes, it’s been almost two years since our last post. You might think that that means little or
    nothing has been happening with the project, and mostly this is true, but not entirely.</p>
    <p>Let’s start with the thing that prompted this post in the first place. A great man once
    said:</p>
    <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
      <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
      "“One does not simply get greenlit on Steam.”" src=
      "../../imgs/blarg/2014/05/boromir-One-does-not-simply-walk-into-Mordor.jpg"></div>
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">
        “One does not simply get greenlit on Steam.”
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>But, as we all know, Sean tends to be wrong about these things. As a matter of fact,
    <strong>Naev has been officially greenlit</strong>. This came as something as a surprise, since
    although people did occasionally comment and vote on the <a href=
    "https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=93971156&amp;tscn=1400016324">Greenlight
    page</a> it was by no means a hive of activity. But there you have it. Needless to say this is
    good news indeed.</p>
    <p>In other news, work has been going into the core slots system that currently only exists in
    the development version. The system is described in earlier posts, and Deiz has been improving
    the core outfit definitions. You can view <a href=
    "https://web.archive.org/web/20170730021511/http://wiki.naev.org/wiki/Core_slots_balancing_2">his
    notes</a> on the wiki. Once that is finished we’re hoping to get the game ready for a new
    release numbered 0.6.0. We may yet run into issues that have to be resolved first, but we’d
    really like to get a new release out the door in hopes of rekindling interest in the project.
    Fingers crossed!</p>
    <p>There has also been some discussion recently about the relationship between armour and
    shields within the game. There is some <a href=
    "https://web.archive.org/web/20170730021150/http://wiki.naev.org/wiki/Armour_Revamp">writing
    about that</a> on the wiki as well. It should be noted that this is not a proposal or anything
    we plan to do, at this point we haven’t decided on any course of action and the floor remains
    open for debate.</p>
    <p>Other than that a whole slew of minor corrections and content has also been constantly
    creeping in from a lot of different people. We hope this will make the experience smoother and
    more enjoyable for everyone.</p>
    <p>That’s it for now. Let’s hope there won’t be too much time until the next blog post.</p>
