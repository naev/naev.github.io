    <h2>Sporadic Naev Newsletter Vol. 3</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON SEPTEMBER 5TH, 2023</p>
    <p>Rather than waiting 10 years again from the previous edition of our <a href=
    "../2021-08-22_sporadic_naev_newsletter_vol_2/">sporadic naev newsletter</a>, we’ve only let 2
    years pass this time. In this edition, we’ll talk about some improvements in 0.10.0 that may
    have gone under the radar, and the upcoming 0.11.0 release.</p>
    <h4 id="state-of-0110">State of 0.11.0</h4>
    <p>With <a href="https://github.com/naev/naev/compare/0.10.x...main">a ton of commits and
    content since 0.10.0</a>, things are starting to shape up for 0.11.0. This release has focused
    greatly on reworking and improving existing systems by bringing up to modern standards. In
    particular, things such as how weapons are implemented, how ship stats are dealt with, autonav
    internals, npc/news/derelict internals, reworking old missions into the visual novel system,
    etc. have been mainly rewritten to improve shortcomings. While this is not really visible in
    the end product directly, it has enabled a lots of new features and improved the overall
    robustness of the game.</p>
    <p>However, this release is much more than just elimination of technical debt, as this release
    features a lot of new content in pretty much every area of the game: more events, more
    missions, more lore, more outfits, and more locations. The icing on the cake are new mechanics
    such as point defense systems, flow mechanics, and trials. Overall this is shaping up to be
    quite a large release and we are excited to share it with you.</p>
    <h4 id="universe-revisited">Universe Revisited</h4>
    <p>As <a href="../2023-02-12_universe_revisited/">mentioned before on the blarg</a>, the
    universe has been completely rework for 0.11.0. The universe should have a much more natural
    feel that matches the lore, with the Sol Nebula being more omnipresent as you travel around.
    This has required significant changes to many systems and system objects, so that many places
    you knew will probably seem familiar but quite different at the same time. It may take a while
    to get used to.</p>
    <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
      <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
      "Stumbling upon a ruined space station in the Nebula." src=
      "../../imgs/blarg/2023/nebula_ruined_station.png"></div>
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In numbers, some 67 new systems and 123 new space objects have been added, mainly around the
    Sol Nebula to give a more in-depth sensation of destruction and the fragility of humankind.
    Besides the typical planets and stations, these systems also contain many secrets that you can
    uncover.</p>
    <h4 id="house-sirius-rework">House Sirius Rework</h4>
    <p>For 0.10.0, the Soromid got a major rework by getting true bioships that can level up and
    learn different skills, now it’s only fair for the neglected House Sirius to also get the same
    treatment. Instead of extreme biological engineering, House Sirius relies on psychic abilities
    called flow. While individuals don’t possess very strong powers by themselves, House Sirius has
    designed their ships to be powerful amplifiers to be able to unleash potent abilities on the
    battle field.</p>
    <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
      <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
      "The player unleashing an astral projection made of psychic energy to fight for them against pirates."
      src="../../imgs/blarg/2023/sirius_astral_projection.png"></div>
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">

        pirates.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The player will also be able to obtain similar psychic powers and unlock the full potential
    through new tests that can be found throughout space. Each test will require the player to
    overcome obstacles in order to unlock new abilities and also increase their overall psychic
    powers.</p>
    <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
      <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
      "Complete tests to unlock new psychic powers." src=
      "../../imgs/blarg/2023/sirius_test.png"></div>
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">
        Complete tests to unlock new psychic powers.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>While Sirius ships have flow capability built-in, other ships can also use structural
    outfits to enable flow capability, allowing for more customization. That said, Sirius ships get
    unique bonuses from flow powers which are not available to other ships.</p>
    <h4 id="plugin-system">Plugin System</h4>
    <p>Although the <a href="../2022-12-23_0.10.0/">plugin system was introduced in 0.10.0</a>, it
    has gone largely unnoticed. Currently, it is possible to replace and modify all parts of the
    Naev that are implemented in Lua, which includes important parts such as <a href=
    "../2023-07-30_new_autonav/">autonav</a>, <a href="../2021-06-06_lua_outfits/">many
    outfits</a>, <a href="../2023-07-18_ships_go_boom/">ship explosions</a>, and more! Not only
    that, Naev has option networking built in with <a href="http://enet.bespin.org/">enet</a>,
    allowing for networking functionality. On this line, there is a very much WIP <a href=
    "https://github.com/ThrosturX/naev-multiplayer">multiplayer plugin</a>, that allows for playing
    with other people. To make development somewhat easier, a <a href=
    "https://naev.org/devmanual/">development manual</a> is being worked on, which covers things
    like how to write content for Naev and how to structure plugins. Given the advanced programming
    possibilities with the <a href="https://naev.org/api/">Naev Lua API</a>, the only limit is your
    imagination!</p>
    <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
      <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
      "The simple shader plugin can be useful for older hardware." src=
      "../../imgs/blarg/2023/plugins_menu.png"></div>
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Oh, there is <a href="https://github.com/naev/total_conversion_plugin_example">explicit
    support for total conversions</a> too!</p>
    <h4 id="new-content">New Content</h4>
    <p>There’s also a bunch of new content being worked on. Not only have the NPCs and news you can
    find at the spaceport bar been greatly reworked to me more relevant to the context at hand, but
    many new missions, factions, and mechanisms have been implemented. The new universe has also
    given opportunities to diversify the different factions and make them feel more unique, from
    taunts to landing messages.</p>
    <p>First of all, with optimizations done to the engine, it’s finally possible to have efficient
    point defense systems, something that has been asked for by players for a long time. Point
    defense systems will automatically target nearby missiles, torpedoes, and even interceptors! Of
    course the exact specs will depend on the outfit, Guardian Systems use powerful lasers to focus
    on torpedoes or interceptors, while Soromid Spittle Clusters have been bio-engineered to create
    screens of bubbles to block weaker, but faster missiles.</p>
    <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
      <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
      "A Soromid Ira trying to stop incoming torpedoes with spittle." src=
      "../../imgs/blarg/2023/spittle.png"></div>
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">
        A Soromid Ira trying to stop incoming torpedoes with spittle.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>A new neutral faction has been created to replace the old Trader’s Guild. The new Space
    Traders Society is an organization that spans different guilds and has important subfactions
    such as the mercenary guild Astra Vigilis, the Mining Vrata, and the Imperial Red Star. They
    have important presence in several systems where new outfits are also available for trade.</p>
    <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
      <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
      "The Mining Vrata Guildhouse." src="../../imgs/blarg/2023/mining_vrata.png"></div>
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Finally, more events missions have been added throughout the universe, and although not
    finished yet, we expect the conclusion to the Minerva campaign to make it into 0.11.0.</p>
    <h4 id="game-optimization">Game Optimization</h4>
    <p>One issue Naev has traditionally had with the large systems it features, is slow downs when
    many pilots were fighting each other as a result of a primitive collision system. Well, it is
    no longer an issue as the current system has been reworked with <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree">quadtrees</a>. Testing shows that it is much much
    faster in extreme cases, with the game easily handling hundreds of ships fighting each other
    without slowing down. Furthermore, many aspects of the game have been profiled and optimized
    such that the game should run much more fluid than 0.10.0.</p>
    <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
      <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
      "Naev running smoothly at 60 FPS despite 50 Dvaered Vendettas fighting with 50 FLF Lancelots."
      src="../../imgs/blarg/2023/skirmish_benchmark.png"></div>
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">

        Lancelots.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Tests show that where Naev 0.10.0 would choke and become a slide show, Naev 0.11.0 will be
    able to run without a hitch, such as 50 Dvaered Vendettas fighting with 50 FLF Lancelots. That
    said, given the high levels of time compressions capital ships can reach, it is likely in some
    extreme cases you may experience some slow downs.</p>
    <h4 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding Remarks</h4>
    <p>This concludes the Sporadic Naev Newsletter Vol. 3, and see you again in the next one!</p>
