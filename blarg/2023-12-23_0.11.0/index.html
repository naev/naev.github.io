    <h2>Naev 0.11.0</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">BY NAEV DEVTEAM, ON DECEMBER 23RD, 2023</p>
    <p>Following the winter tradition, the Naev DevTeam is proud to announce the release of version
    0.11.0. This is again quite a large release that has rewritten and reworked large parts of the
    engine and long-established mechanics to be more flexible, faster, and efficient. Many
    long-term players will notice that many things they had gotten used to have been changed,
    starting from the Naev universe itself.</p>
    <p>We would like to thank all the contributors who have participated and helped in the making
    of this release.</p>
    <p>Most notable changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reworked universe map to fit existing lore</li>
      <li>House Sirius completely reworked</li>
      <li>Improved autonav that uses lanes and is configurable</li>
      <li>Reworked structural outfits and number of ship slots</li>
      <li>Weapon sets are more simple with no distinction between weapons and non-weapons</li>
      <li>Possible to legally obtain all “standard” factional ships and outfits</li>
      <li>Point defense weapons that automatically fire at fighters and missiles</li>
      <li>A lot more content</li>
      <li>Significant engine speed-ups</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can get the latest version from any of the following sources:</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/naev/naev/releases/v0.11.0"><img src=
    "../../imgs/badges/github.svg" alt="Get - Github"></a></p>
    <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/598530/Naev"><img src=
    "../../imgs/badges/steam.svg" alt="Get - Steam"></a></p>
    <p><a href="https://naev.itch.io/naev"><img src="../../imgs/badges/itchio.svg" alt=
    "Get - Itch.io"></a></p>
    <p><a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.naev.Naev"><img src=
    "../../imgs/badges/flathub.svg" alt="Get - Flathub"></a></p>
    <p>The new version should be compatible with older save games, and will update things as
    necessary. However, in this release, given the big changes done to the universe, old saves will
    potentially have the their universe map in a bit of a mess.</p>
