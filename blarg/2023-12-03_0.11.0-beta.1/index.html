    <h2>Naev 0.11.0-beta.1</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON DECEMBER 3RD, 2023</p>
    <p>It’s nearing the end of the year and that means time for a new Naev release! This release is
    once again one that revamps a lot of existing features and legacy code, while adding lots of
    new content and features. Like always, instead of doing a release directly, we’re going to be
    doing a series of betas to try to ensure as few bugs as possible sneak into the final release.
    We plan to do the official release in about two weeks from now, but it will depend on how many
    issues and the likes are found.</p>
    <p>Now, this release changes a lot of how the game currently plays, and, while it is highly
    recommended to start a new game, it should be possible to just load up your old saves without
    too much stuff being changed. In particular, some of the major changes are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Significantly reworked universe map to fit existing lore</li>
      <li>House Sirius completely reworked</li>
      <li>Significantly improved autonav that uses lanes and is configurable</li>
      <li>Reworked structural outfits and number of ship slots</li>
      <li>Weapon sets are more simple with no distinction between weapons and non-weapons</li>
      <li>Possible to legally obtain all “standard” factional ships and outfits</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you try it and find any issues, please report them at <a href=
    "https://github.com/naev/naev/issues">the issue tracker</a>. Discussion about the game can be
    had on one of the various discussion forums and chatrooms we have. Check them out <a href=
    "https://naev.org/contact/">here!</a></p>
    <p>You can get the new version from any of the sources below:</p>
