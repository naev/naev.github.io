    <h2>Expanding on faction standing and landing</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">BY DEIZ, ON JUNE 20TH, 2011</p>
    <p>To provide a brief overview: In 0.5.1, the landing and faction standing mechanics will be
    changing in a big way. They’re both no longer hard-coded in C, having been moved to flexible
    Lua scripts that can operate differently for each faction.</p>
    <p>Important military outposts and such will now be restricted to factional allies, seldom (if
    ever) accepting bribes, and attaining standing with a faction will require campaign missions
    rather than just killing the faction’s enemies.</p>

    <h4 id="landing">Landing</h4>
    <p>Landing has long been a rather simple mechanic in Naev. Plainly, being neutral or friendly
    with a faction means you can land on any of their assets — up to, and including, their primary
    military and political headquarters. Likewise, if you’re hostile with a faction, you can simply
    bribe your way into the spaceport.</p>
    <p>Yet somehow, it seems that high-ranking bureaucrats and military officers might frown on
    enemies of the state traipsing around their headquarters after throwing a few credits at the
    landing control officer. As such, it’s become a priority to do away with the overly-simplistic
    permission system.</p>
    <p>Our new mechanic for this is rather more nuanced. As we’ve done with many things, landing is
    now handled through Lua — the behaviour is no longer hard-coded in C. The simplistic
    landable-if-not-hostile model has been replaced with a ternary system that can operate
    differently per-faction: while civilian worlds will let neutral strangers land, important
    factional outposts will typically be restricted to allies. Correspondingly, a backwater
    civilian settlement that you’re hostile with is likely to turn a blind eye if you pay them off,
    while officers at a military outpost will tend to be far less lenient.</p>
    <p>The restricted assets are also divided into tiers. While an outsider will be able to land at
    most of a faction’s military assets after doing a number of missions for them, key assets such
    as faction home worlds will remain off-limits to all but close allies.</p>
    <h4 id="standing">Standing</h4>
    <p>A second, closely-related mechanic is faction standing. Like landing, it’s also far from
    optimal in 0.5.0 and earlier — you can become a faction’s trusted ally simply by going on a
    brief rampage and killing off a number of their enemies’ ships.</p>
    <p>This may even happen inadvertently through normal gameplay. It’s a given that players are
    attacked by pirates in many areas of the galaxy, and since pirates are a common enemy among
    many of the lawful factions, simply fighting off pirates ingratiates players with all of these
    factions.</p>
    <p>For 0.5.1, it’s undergoing a substantial revamp. Like landing, the previously hard-coded
    behaviour has been replaced with a flexible Lua solution. Generally, killing alone won’t take
    you terribly far. To become an ally of a faction, it will be necessary to do missions for
    them.</p>
    <p>Grunt-work such as cargo ferrying and patrol missions won’t go all the way, either. Each
    faction has two ceilings on standing. The first is the point at which killing stops increasing
    your standing, and the other is the limit on how far normal missions can raise it.</p>
    <p>To become a faction’s ally, you’ll need to do campaign missions for them. The reputation
    limit that regular missions can reach will be increased by the campaign missions, essentially
    representing an increased willingness for the faction to trust you.</p>
    <p>The way reputation is gained through killing is also changing. The 0.5.0 reputation system
    is essentially omniscient. If you kill a pirate out in the middle of nowhere with no witnesses,
    your standing will still go up with all pirate enemies.</p>
    <p>The new system operates on two levels. Killing a faction’s enemies in systems that the
    faction inhabits will trigger a normal standing increase, because you’re directly defending
    them and their populace. The other case is where you’re fighting a faction’s enemies outside of
    the faction’s space. In this instance, killing a faction’s enemies only increases your standing
    if the faction has a ship that’s within sensor range.</p>
    <p>Plainly put, a faction should only take notice if your actions affect them in a direct
    manner. The Empire shouldn’t care if you kill a pirate deep within Sirius space, nor vice
    versa.</p>
    <p>We hope that these mechanics will make general faction relationships more compelling, and
    ideally they will serve to distinguish factions from each other, rather than faction standing
    polarizing into lawful versus lawless, with one group of factions at 100% and the other at
    -100%.</p>
    <p>The Naev devteam is proud to announce the release of Naev 0.5.0! This release is the result
    of over a year of hard work done by nearly 30 committers. This release is just a step in the
    path for ultimate greatness and a major step forward in the maturity of Naev. It has many major
    gameplay changes and signifies the coming of age of Naev, which has now exceeded the tag of
    Escape Velocity clone.</p>
