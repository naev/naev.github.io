    <h2>0.5.0 Status Update</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON DECEMBER 21ST, 2010</p>
    <p>We haven’t posted in a while, so I decided to update even though we don’t have anything
    spectacular done (depending on your definition of spectacular). So what is going on? As you may
    know the current development and broken branch is the balance branch (This branch is now long
    dead, unsure of the commit sha). This branch is active and <strong>will mangle your
    saves</strong> if you load it. Why? It’s caused by the implementation of <a href=
    "https://groups.google.com/d/topic/naev/NAofWIqhsQ4">the weapon rant</a>, which makes it so all
    the weapon are changed. Some retain their name, but most get lost in the transition. This is
    unavoidable and will happen to everyone once it’s merged back, but it shouldn’t happen again
    then.</p>
    <p>Other things, ewarfare has more or less been balanced. We’ve introduced another parameter
    for heat. So the more your ship heats up, the more visible it is. The equations are also
    tweaked in such a way they make more sense and are cooler overall. Also turrets finally use it,
    so you can’t track a fighter with a long range anti-capship turret. This all may still need
    fine tuning but it is working quite well.</p>
    <p>Another major change which has broken a lot of missions is the fact we’ve changed the time
    model. Previously time only changed when you landed or jumped. Now time will change while
    flying too. That means that slower ships will waste more time in system while jump times will
    be very similar. This sort of makes everything more interesting and realistic which is quite
    cool. However it means we have to revamp all our cargo missions which we want to rethink anyway
    when we do economics. For now we’ll probably keep them similar to how they’ve always been, but
    in the future we’ll change it.</p>
    <p>Finally mentioning some changes we want to do. With google being more and more evil, we’ve
    been thinking of completely foregoing both google code and google groups. We’re working on
    having our own wiki which shouldn’t take too long to be available. If someone is really
    interested in helping out we can sort of speed it up and spread the half-finishedness. It still
    needs lots of love. Secondly we’re considering the possibility of also hosting our own mailing
    list, but we’ll see about that. That hasn’t even been started.</p>
    <p>Closing words on the release. The original intention was to release end of 2010, however we
    believe it is much more important to have a good solid release than a half-finished rushed
    release that will need a dozen bugfixes to be playable. We would like to still release at the
    end of 2010, but chances are we’ll just do a beta at the start of 2011. There’s still much to
    do, need to finish some stuff and then fix everything we broke. To speed up the release we are
    trying to delay changes that aren’t fundamental, however we also want this release to sort of
    establish the maturity of Naev, but chances are 0.6.0 will be the true maturity once we get
    there.</p>
    <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> We’ll release when it’s ready :)</p>
