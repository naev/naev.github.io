    <h2>Sporadic Naev Newsletter Vol. 4</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">BY BOBBENS, ON JULY 21ST, 2024</p>
    <p>This year we’re having another edition of our Sporadic Naev Newsletter. We’ll be covering
    <a href="https://github.com/naev/naev/blob/main/CHANGELOG">some of the improvements</a> that
    will appear in the 0.12.0 release, and more importantly, discuss a feature almost 15 years in
    the making: Naev going 3D! Now, this doesn’t mean gameplay is going 3D - gameplay is
    fundamentally unchanged - however, the ship models are now in 3D, allowing us to do new fancy
    effects and lower memory consumption while at it!</p>
    <figure class="figure embed-responsive video720p">
      <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 figure-img">
        <video controls="" class="embed-responsive-item"><source src=
        "../../videos/blarg/2024/3dspin.webm" type='video/webm;codecs="vp9, opus"'></video>
      </div>
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">
        Nearly all ships are now in 3D!
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h4 id="less-pirates-in-the-early-game">Less Pirates in the Early Game</h4>
    <p>One of the major complaints that Naev always gets is how ruthless pirates are, especially in
    the early game, when the player has no proper defenses. Although the past several releases have
    tried to mitigate the issue by establishing a safe starting area with no pirates, and adding
    more introductory missions to help the player get started, for those players that strayed too
    far from the starting area, it was often fatal. Now, Chapter 0 will feature significantly less
    pirates, that will ramp up to normal when the player reaches Chapter 1. This should give the
    player time to get better ships and survive the pirate menace.</p>
    <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
      <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
      "Universe diff support in the universe editor." src=
      "../../imgs/blarg/2024/uniedit_diff.png"></div>
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">
        Universe diff support in the universe editor.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In order to implement this feature, the in-game universe editor was significantly reworked
    (yet again!) to support universe diffs, that is, instead of saving the entire universe, only
    changes with the default are saved. While this has been used only for reducing pirates, for
    now, this is going to come very in hand when implementing the next stages of the major
    campaigns, where the universe will undergo many significant changes. It will definitely be a
    good investment for things to come.</p>
    <h4 id="naev-now-in-3d">Naev, now in 3D!</h4>
    <p>So, while this is something that was proposed around 15 years ago, this is something that
    has been quite active in the works for almost 5 years now. During that time, it has been
    rewritten twice: first using object files and more traditional rendering, and now using gltf
    files with physically-based rendering. As we’re not using any sort of game engine, it was all
    written from the ground up, and includes some fancy things like variance shadow maps,
    FidelityFX filtering, high dynamic tone mapping, and super sampling. There’s still many things
    to do, but this finally lets us start to do fancier things that were infeasible using
    spritesheets. That said, spritesheets are still supported, however, 3D models are the
    recommended way of adding new ships.</p>
    <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
      <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
      "The system you are in will subtly change the lighting on all ships." src=
      "../../imgs/blarg/2024/3dlighting.png"></div>
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">
        The system you are in will subtly change the lighting on all ships.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>It has taken a lot of work, but all the ancient models have been updated to work with the
    newest blender, and many models have seen upgrades in different aspects like texturing, engine
    glows, broken geometry, and animations. Some ships have had to be nearly completely remade to
    work with current standards. There’s still a lot to do, but they look much better, and the same
    model can be used in the shipyard, communication window, and in-game.</p>
    <figure class="figure embed-responsive video720p">
      <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 figure-img">
        <video controls="" class="embed-responsive-item"><source src=
        "../../videos/blarg/2024/3dzebra.webm" type='video/webm;codecs="vp9, opus"'></video>
      </div>
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">
        3D models support animations, such as the Zebra having rotating parts.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>With 3D, we finally can also have ships tilt slightly when turning. This makes flying feel
    much more natural, and the tilt shows off more highlights and details of the ships. While we
    were hoping to add blinking lights and more details, those have not yet been implemented, but
    there is a real possibility that they will come sooner and later, once some logistics are
    figured out.</p>
    <figure class="figure embed-responsive video720p">
      <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 figure-img">
        <video controls="" class="embed-responsive-item"><source src=
        "../../videos/blarg/2024/3dgoddard.webm" type='video/webm;codecs="vp9, opus"'></video>
      </div>
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">
        Ships tilt slightly when turning. Weapon mounts and trails adjust to the 3D models.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>For now, only ships have been reworked into 3D, but we hope to have planets, stations, and
    asteroids to join them in the near future. Some effects such as the backgrounds, wormholes, and
    the likes will still be kept in 2D, however, it will all work much better together. Oh, and
    last but not least, we’ve taken this opportunity to add 4 new ships to flesh out a bit more the
    Naev universe!</p>
    <h4 id="linear-energy-regeneration">Linear Energy Regeneration</h4>
    <p>Although many players had not noticed, energy regeneration in Naev used an RC
    (Resistance-Capacitor) charge curve, which meant that energy would regenerate faster the less
    you had, and slowly taper out. This was not properly conveyed to the player and has now made
    linear. Now 100 GW of energy regeneration will always be 100 GJ of energy generated per second.
    While it is not possible to keep exactly the same behaviour as before, outfits and ships have
    been adjusted to try to be as similar as before the change.</p>
    <h4 id="quality-of-life-for-all">Quality of Life for all!</h4>
    <p>A lot of Quality of Life has also made it into the nightly. Spaceport bar is marked with red
    exclamation points when there is an interesting NPC, there is support for sorting and filtering
    mission computer missions, repeated messages get folded in the GUI, asteroids won’t disappear
    when the player is nearby or actively targeting them, and much more! This should ensure a
    smoother experience for the players and get rid of lots of small friction.</p>
    <figure class="figure embed-responsive" style="text-align:center;">
      <div class="embed-responsive figure-img"><img class="img-fluid" alt=
      "You can now sort missions and it is easier to tell when new missions are available at the spaceport bar."
      src="../../imgs/blarg/2024/qol.png"></div>
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">
        You can now sort missions and it is easier to tell when new missions are available at the
        spaceport bar.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Additionally, the game uses lazy loading and threading to load much faster than before,
    starting up much faster and using less memory in general.</p>
    <h4 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding Remarks</h4>
    <p>All the aforementioned fixes can be already tasted in the nightly branch which can be
    obtained through the steam beta, <a href=
    "https://github.com/naev/naev/releases/tag/nightly">github</a>, or <a href=
    "https://naev.itch.io/naev">itch.io</a>. They will be included in the next 0.12.0 release which
    is scheduled for December if you’d rather wait for a more stable release instead of risking the
    bleeding edge. If you’re interested in seeing the full changelog, including things that have
    not been discussed here, it’s <a href=
    "https://github.com/naev/naev/blob/main/CHANGELOG">available on github</a>. With that, this
    concludes the Sporadic Naev Newsletter Vol. 4, and see you again in the next one!</p>
